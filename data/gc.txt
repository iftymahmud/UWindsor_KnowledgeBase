NOTIFICATION OF DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION TO
STATISTICS CANADA
Statistics Canada is the national statistical agency. As such, Statistics Canada carries out hundreds of surveys
each year on a wide range of matters, including education.

It is essential to be able to follow students across time and institutions to understand, for example, the factors
affecting enrollment demand at post-secondary institutions. The increased emphasis on accountability for
public investment means that it is also important to understand outcomes. In order to carry out such studies,
Statistics Canada asks all colleges and universities to provide data on students and graduates. Institutions
collect and provide to Statistics Canada student identification information (student's name, student ID number,
Social Insurance Number), student contact information (address and telephone number), student demographic
characteristics, enrollment information, previous education, and labour force activity.

The Federal Statistics Act provides the legal authority for Statistics Canada to obtain access to personal
information held by educational institutions. The information may be used only for statistical purposes, and the
confidentiality provisions of the Statistics Act prevent the information from being released in any way that
would identify a student.

Students who do not wish to have their information used are able to ask Statistics Canada to remove their
identification and contact information from the national database.

Further information on the use of this information can be obtained from Statistics' Canada's web site:
http://www.statcan.ca or by writing to the Postsecondary Section, Centre for Education Statistics, 17th Floor,
R.H. Coats Building, Tunney's Pasture, Ottawa, K1A 0T6.

ACADEMIC REGULATIONS
FACULTY REGULATIONS FOR THE DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY
Admission Requirements for the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)
Graduates of recognized universities may apply for admission. In general, admission to graduate study is
granted only to those students who have good academic records and who are adequately prepared to
undertake graduate work in their field of specialization. In particular, an applicant for admission to a graduate
program leading to the degree of Doctor of Philosophy must have either a Master's degree or, in exceptional
cases, a four-year Bachelor's degree, or the equivalent; with a minimum average of 77% (or equivalent).
Possession of the minimum requirements does not ensure admission.

Fast Track Admission to the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)
This process allows a student to enter the PhD program without first completing the Master’s degree.
Recommendations from the program must be made no earlier than Term 3, and be approved prior to the
completion of Term 4 of the Master’s degree. Recommendations received beyond the end of Term 4 will not be
considered. To be eligible, the student must have completed all graduate courses for the Master’s degree and
must have obtained a minimum 80% average. The supervisory committee must recommend the transfer, in
writing, based on demonstrated excellence in research and provide evidence of a complete plan of research for
the doctoral degree. All applications must be approved by the Faculty of Graduate Studies.

Program Requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy

Residence
Residence requirements are intended to provide for each student an adequate contact with the University,
with the faculty in the field of specialization, and with the library, laboratories, and other facilities for graduate
study and research. Every student in a program leading to the degree of Doctor of Philosophy must be
registered in a full-time program of study for a minimum of three calendar years, normally in succession. Credit
for one of these years may be given for the time spent in proceeding to a Master's degree.

Transfer credits will only be granted at the time of admission, and recommendations must be included with the
offer of admission. Normally, credits must have been received in the last 5 years with a minimum grade of 70%,
and no credits used towards a previously completed certificate, diploma, or degree or used as a basis of
admission will be approved as credit toward a Windsor graduate degree. A maximum of 50% of the Windsor
course degree requirements will be approved for transfer credit, excluding internship/practicum, thesis,
dissertation, or comprehensive examination courses.

If transfer credit is granted, the student may be required to take alternate course(s) as recommended by the
program. Approved transfer credit will appear on the student’s transcript.

A full-time residence year indicates that a student is in full-time work under the direction of a faculty member
at the University of Windsor.

Candidacy
Admission to graduate study does not imply admission to candidacy for a degree. Admission to candidacy for
the degree of Doctor of Philosophy is granted by the Dean of Graduate Studies, upon recommendation of the
program concerned, when a student has satisfied the requirements for candidacy of the Faculty of Graduate
Studies and of the program, as may be specified in program listings in the calendar. Admission to candidacy is
normally to be regarded as recognition that a student has given adequate evidence of superior capability and
                                                                                                                    10

achievement in graduate study. A student may not be admitted to candidacy for the degree of Doctor of
Philosophy before passing a comprehensive examination in the field of specialization.

Time Limit
A student admitted to a PhD program must complete all requirements for the PhD. within six consecutive
years.

If an extension of the time limit becomes necessary, the student should address a petition to the Dean of
Graduate Studies giving reasons for the request and plans for the completion of the work. A student who
exceeds the time limit may be required to take additional qualifying examinations or additional course work, or
both.

Course of Study
Course requirements are specified in the program listings. Planning and direction of the student's course of
study are the responsibility of the program coordinator or a designated departmental advisor. A specific
program of study should be worked out at the time of the student's first registration, in consultation with the
program.

Since in several programs only a few courses listed will be offered each year, students are advised to ascertain
from the program area which courses will be offered in any given year.

In consultation with their program area, all students must complete an Annual Report, which is to be submitted
to their department by May 31 of each year.

It is expected that students working toward the degree of Doctor of Philosophy will maintain a superior average
in all course work. Normally, graduate credit will be given only for courses in which a minimum 70% grade has
been achieved. See also Senate Policy on Grading and Calculation of Averages.

Committees
Research undertaken as part of a doctoral program is normally directed by a faculty supervisor and advised by a
doctoral committee.

By the end of the first term of registration in the dissertation, the program will recommend the appointment of
members of the doctoral committee, whose appointments must be approved by the Faculty of Graduate
Studies. At the same time the candidate will be required to validate the Non-Exclusive License to the University
of Windsor authorizing the University to archive, reproduce, and distribute the dissertation.

The doctoral committee will include as a minimum a research supervisor or co-supervisors from the program,
who is(are) a member of graduate faculty, two other program readers, and one outside program reader from
the University of Windsor. The outside program reader may not be cross appointed to the program in which
the student is registered. Additional members may be added with the approval of the program and the Faculty
of Graduate Studies. This committee will, from time to time, review the student's progress.

The majority of the members of an advisory committee must have graduate faculty status and the supervisor
must have full graduate faculty status. In the case of co-supervision one of the co-supervisors must have full
graduate faculty status, see Senate Policy on Graduate Faculty Designation.

The doctoral committee is also charged with conduct of the final examination of the doctoral candidate




                                                                                                                   11
Spring 2024 Academic Calendar
For the defense of the dissertation (final oral examination), the committee will be supplemented by an
independent, external examiner who, as an expert in the field in which the candidate's research is carried out,
will appraise the dissertation and ordinarily will also be present at the final oral examination.

The external examiner will be recommended by the doctoral committee, subject to the approval of the
program area and the Dean of Graduate Studies. The external examiner must not be involved in the
preparation of the dissertation before it is submitted to him or her for final evaluation.

If the research involves information gathered from or about human participants (including primary data
collection, use of human biological materials, and secondary uses of information), the faculty supervisor and
graduate student are responsible for the ethical conduct of the study, the completion of the project as
described in the ethics application cleared by the Research Ethics Board (REB) and the protection of the rights
and welfare of human participants. The supervisor ensures that all required clearances and permissions are
obtained prior to commencement of the research. The graduate student and faculty supervisor submit an
application to the Research Ethics Board (REB) Research involving human subjects cannot begin until ethics
clearance has been obtained. (Consult with the Research Ethics Board (REB)).

All research conducted at the University of Windsor is subject to the institutional policies as described in
Research Integrity and the Responsible Conduct of Research and University of Windsor Guidelines for Research
Involving Human Research Participants. If the research involves animal care, biohazards, health and safety,
radiation, or any other procedure that requires certification, the supervisor of the research is responsible for
obtaining prior approval from the respective committees. (Consult with the Office of Research and Innovation
Services).

The Dissertation for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy

A dissertation embodying the results of an original investigation in the field of specialization is required of all
candidates for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy.

The regulations of individual programs should be consulted for details of their dissertation procedures. The
general format is prescribed in the Guidelines for Major Papers, Theses, and Dissertations, which may be
obtained from the Faculty of Graduate Studies or from www.uwindsor.ca/graduate. Within the dissertation,
the student should use formats approved for scholarly publication in the field of specialization and approved by
the program. Final checking of the general format of the dissertation is the responsibility of the Faculty of
Graduate Studies, but the student should consult the doctoral committee for instructions as to the internal
form of the dissertation.

Copies of a PhD dissertation are to be provided to all members of the doctoral committee and two copies to
the Faculty of Graduate Studies, of which one copy will be transmitted to the external examiner, at least four
weeks before the expected date of defense. Before the dissertation is forwarded to the external examiner, all
members of the doctoral committee must read and provide feedback on the dissertation, and it must be
approved by the majority of the committee. No changes may be made to the dissertation document or
composition of the doctoral committee between these deadline dates and the defense except under the most
extraordinary circumstances and with approval of the Executive Committee of Graduate Studies. The oral
presentation should be completed at least three weeks prior to the Convocation for which the candidate has
applied to receive the degree. A public notice of defense must be received in the Office of Graduate Studies
and posted in the academic unit at least eight days in advance of the oral presentation.

A doctoral committee shall notify the Faculty of Graduate Studies whether, in its view, notice of defense is to
be posted, but the decision to proceed shall be contingent upon the report of the external examiner to the
Dean of Graduate Studies.

                                                                                                                      12
Spring 2024 Academic Calendar
The candidate will present the dissertation at a public defense. The Chair of a PhD defense will be the Dean of
Graduate Studies or designate, such as the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies, Dean of a Faculty or senior
member of graduate faculty from outside the program, to be named by the Dean of Graduate Studies at the
time the defense is publicly announced. The chair is non-voting. Questions will be permitted from the general
audience at the discretion of the chair. The general audience may remain until the defense is completed and
the committee begins its deliberations on the outcome. These deliberations are held in camera.

The minimum basis for acceptance of a PhD dissertation shall be positive unanimity less one vote providing the
dissenting vote is not by an external examiner who is present at the defense, and the chair of the defense
determines that the examination by the external examiner has been fair to the candidate. Unless an examining
committee is unanimously negative, a candidate may resubmit the dissertation once, after a minimum period
of three months and before a maximum period of twelve months. The second decision shall be final.

The dissertation must be deposited with the Faculty of Graduate Studies at least two weeks prior to
Convocation.

Arrangements for the deposit, including online electronic submission, binding the dissertation and payment of
binding fees, where applicable, should be made with Graduate Studies. The University will add the dissertation
to the “Scholarship at UWindsor” online institutional repository and transmit a copy of the dissertation to
Library and Archives Canada, under the authority of a "Thesis/Dissertation Non-Exclusive License", supplied by
the Faculty of Graduate Studies and validated by the candidate. The license authorizes Library and Archives
Canada and Leddy Library to publish, reproduce, and transform the dissertation in any format, print or online.
The deposited dissertation becomes the property of the University.

Occasionally, it is necessary to withhold the dissertation from public circulation, especially where the student's
interests (e.g., patent rights) would be jeopardized by publication. In such cases, a thesis may be held from the
public domain, i.e., the online repository, the Leddy Library and Library and Archives of Canada. Such delay in
circulation may be requested for six months without cause being given, and an additional period of six months
with good cause. Forms for withholding dissertation are available from the Faculty of Graduate Studies.

PhD Examinations
In addition to the usual examinations on course work, there are three types of special examinations which that
may be required (see individual program regulations) in the program leading to the degree of Doctor of
Philosophy:

1.Qualifying Examinations: A qualifying examination is one in which the student is asked to demonstrate a
reasonable mastery of the fundamentals in the major subject; it is designed to test the student’s preparation
for advanced graduate work. If such an examination is required, it must be administered and passed within one
year after a student enters a graduate program.

2.Comprehensive Examinations: A comprehensive examination is one in which the student is asked to
demonstrate a reasonable mastery of the field of specialization; it is designed to test the student’s command of
knowledge and ability to integrate that knowledge, after completion of all or most of the graduate course work.
Normally, these examinations are completed by the end of the second year of graduate study and are a
prerequisite to admission to candidacy.

3. Final Examinations: The final examination of a doctoral candidate is an oral defense of the dissertation.




                                                                                                               14

FACULTY REGULATIONS FOR THE MASTER’S DEGREE
Admission Requirements
Graduates of recognized universities may be admitted to programs leading to the Master’s degree. A student
with a four-year degree or equivalent in the discipline to which s/he is seeking admission, and who has an
academic standing equivalent to 70% or better in the final two years of study (full time equivalent) may be
admitted to a Master’s program (M2).

An applicant who holds a four-year degree in a related discipline, and who has an academic standing equivalent
to a 70% or better overall and in the final year of study and the major subject, may also be admitted to a
Master’s program as a transitional student. Transitional students are normally required to complete a program
of no more than five specified undergraduate courses in addition to the graduate courses required of regular
students. Upon completion of these extra courses, with a minimum grade as specified by the program, the
student may continue in the Master’s program as a regular student (M2).

An applicant who does not meet minimum departmental program admission requirements, but who can
present evidence of leadership, and/or substantial related work experience, may be considered for
probationary admission upon the recommendation of the program. Students who are accepted on probation
will be required to satisfactorily complete two specified graduate courses in the first term of registration, in
addition to any other admission requirements, before conditions are waived. Graduate credit will be given for
the graduate courses after the conditions are waived. The final decision on probationary admission rests with
the Faculty of Graduate Studies.

An applicant who holds a three-year degree in the discipline to which they are applying, or a four-year degree
in another discipline, and who has an academic standing equivalent to 70% or better overall and in both the
final year of study and major subject may be admitted as a qualifying student, with a recommendation for
advancement to M2 level contingent upon completion of a prescribed set of qualifying courses, with a
minimum grade as specified by the program. Since qualifying students are not candidates for a degree, a
qualifying student is not considered a graduate student (M1).

Applicants are urged to apply as early as possible to enable the program and the Faculty of Graduate Studies to
evaluate qualifications.

Possession of the minimum requirements does not ensure admission.

Candidacy: A student in an M2 program is also a candidate for the Master’s degree. Students in the two-year
M1 program followed by the M2 program are not admitted to candidacy until they have satisfactorily
completed the M1 program. A positive recommendation from a program and approval of that recommendation
are required for a student to proceed to the M2 program.




                                                                                                                   15

Program Requirements for the Master’s Degree

Residence
Residence requirements are intended to provide for each student an adequate contact with the University,
faculty in the field of specialization, the library, laboratories, and with other facilities for graduate study. It is
expected, therefore, that every full-time student in a program leading to the Master's degree will undertake a
full program of study at the M2 level for a minimum of one calendar year or its equivalent. Application and
interpretation of the residence requirement is the responsibility of the Dean of Graduate Studies. If a student
does not expect to fulfill the residence requirement in the normal way, reasons for departing from the norm
should be submitted in writing to the Dean and approval secured for the plan before beginning the graduate
program. See also the section on "Duration of Study".

The residency requirement is not intended to apply to students admitted to graduate programs on a part-time
basis.

Duration of Study
The minimum duration of study for the Master's degree is one calendar year beyond the honours Bachelor's
degree, or its equivalent.

Transfer credits will only be granted at the time of admission, and recommendations must be included with the
offer of admission. Normally, credits must have been received in the last 5 years with a minimum grade of 70%,
and no credits used towards a previously completed certificate, diploma, or degree or used as a basis of
admission will be approved as credit toward a Windsor graduate degree. A maximum of 50% of the Windsor
course degree requirements will be approved for transfer credit, excluding internship/practicum, thesis,
dissertation, or comprehensive examination courses.

If transfer credit is granted, the student may be required to take additional courses. Residency still applies.
Approved transfer credit will appear on the student’s transcript.

Time Limit
Work on a Master's degree must be completed within three consecutive calendar years after the student's first
registration, except for certain Master's programs available on a part-time basis. In these latter programs, the
time limit will depend on the nature of the program but will not normally exceed five consecutive years.

If an extension of these time limits becomes necessary, the student should address a petition to the Dean of
Graduate Studies giving reasons for the request and plans for the completion of the work. A student who
exceeds the time limit may be required to take additional qualifying examinations or additional course work, or
both.

Course of Study
Course requirements are specified in the program listings. Planning and direction of the student's course of
study are the responsibility of the program area. A specific program of study should be worked out at the time
of the student's first registration, in consultation with the program area. Students are directed to obtain the
approval of the program area for changes in the program of study. Training in methodology may be required, at
the discretion of the program.

In consultation with their program, all students must complete an Annual Report which is to be submitted to
their program by May 31 of each year.




                                                                                                                         16
Spring 2024 Academic Calendar
Students working toward the Master's degree must maintain at least a 70% average in all course work. See also
Senate Policy on Grading and Calculation of Averages for details including restrictions on repeating courses.

Committees
Research undertaken as part of a Master's program is normally directed by a faculty supervisor and advised by
a Master's committee. By the end of the first term of registration in the thesis, the program will recommend
the appointment of members of the Master's committee, whose appointments must be approved by the
Faculty of Graduate Studies. At the same time the candidate will be required to validate the Non-Exclusive
License to the University of Windsor authorizing the University to archive, reproduce, and distribute the thesis.

The Master's thesis committee will include as a minimum a research supervisor or co-supervisors from the
program, who is(are) a member of graduate faculty, one other program reader, and one outside program
reader from the University of Windsor. The outside program reader may not be cross appointed to the program
in which the student is registered. Additional members may be added with the approval of the program and the
Faculty of Graduate Studies.

The majority of the members of an advisory committee must have graduate faculty status and the supervisor
must have full graduate faculty status. In the case of co-supervision one of the co-supervisors must have full
graduate faculty status, see Senate Policy on Graduate Faculty Designation.

The Master's committee is also charged with conduct of the final examination of the Master's candidate.

If the research involves information gathered from or about human participants (including primary data
collection, use of human biological materials, and secondary uses of information), the faculty supervisor and
graduate student are responsible for the ethical conduct of the study, the completion of the project as
described in the ethics application cleared by the Research Ethics Board (REB) and the protection of the rights

Spring 2024 Academic Calendar
Thesis or Major Paper for the Master’s Degree

A thesis incorporating the results of an investigation in the field of the major subject may be required of
candidates for the Master's degree.

Candidates for some Master's programs may choose, instead of the course of study including a thesis, a
program requiring additional course work and/or the submission of a major paper or project on which there
will be a final evaluation.

The Major Paper/Project is a scholarly essay/research project that shows evidence of critical analysis and
understanding on a topic approved by the student's supervisor and acknowledged by the program area.

The Major Paper/Project committee will include a supervisor, who is a member of graduate faculty, and one
other program faculty member. Additional members may be added with the approval of the program area.

Upon completion of the Major Paper/Project each student will deliver a public oral presentation and defense
which shall be announced publicly (with a copy sent to the Faculty of Graduate Studies) at least eight days in
advance.

The Major Paper/Project is deposited in the Faculty of Graduate Studies at least two weeks prior to
Convocation.

The regulations of individual programs should also be consulted for details of their thesis or major
paper/project requirements. Numerical grades or Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory may be assigned for theses and
major papers/projects, depending on program policy.

Although in some cases it may be acceptable for more than one candidate to make use of a common set of
data or research findings, each candidate is responsible for a single-authored thesis/major paper.

The regulations of individual programs should be consulted for details of their procedures. The general format
is prescribed in Guidelines for Major Papers, Theses, and Dissertations, which may be obtained from the Faculty
of Graduate Studies. Within the thesis or major paper/project, the student should use formats approved for
scholarly publication in the field of specialization and approved by the program. Final checking of the general
format of the thesis or major paper/project is the responsibility of the Faculty of Graduate Studies, but the
student should consult the Master's committee for instructions as to the internal form of the document.

Copies of the Master's thesis must be provided to all members of the Master's committee and one copy to the
chair of the defense, at least two weeks before the expected date of defense. Students are advised to ascertain
from the academic unit any prior deadline established by the unit. No changes may be made to the thesis or
the Master's committee between these deadline dates and the defense except under the most extraordinary
circumstances and with the approval of the Faculty of Graduate Studies. The oral presentation should be
completed at least three weeks prior to the Convocation at which the candidate expects to receive the degree.

No later than eight days before a proposed defense a Master's committee shall notify the Office of Graduate
Studies that a notice of defense is to be posted. The chair of a Master's defense will be a member of graduate
faculty who has not served on the candidate's Master's committee, and who is appointed by the Department
Head at the time the defense is publicly announced. The chair is non-voting. The general audience may remain
until the defense is completed and the committee begins its deliberations on the outcome. These deliberations
are held in camera.
The minimum basis for acceptance of a Master's thesis is positive unanimity by the examining committee less
one vote. Unless an examining committee is unanimously negative, a candidate may resubmit the thesis once,

                                                                                                                 18

EXAMINATIONS AND GRADING PROCEDURES
A program may require either oral or written examinations in graduate courses. By the first day of each course,
the instructor must provide students with a written course outline which includes precise information
concerning the following (see Bylaw 55: Graduate Academic Evaluation Procedures for complete details):

(a) the basis for determining the final grade in the course;
(b) the approximate dates for tests, essays, etc.

Note, as per Senate Bylaw 55, alterations in the announced procedure may be made by the instructor with the
consent of the majority of the registered class.

APPEALS
In addition to appealing a grade informally (see Bylaw 55), students may formally appeal a grade.

Graduate appeals must be made in writing to the Dean of Graduate Studies, in accordance with the Graduate
Appeals Policy as stated in Senate Bylaw 55: Graduate Academic Evaluation Procedures. Appeals must be
received no later than three weeks after the final mark has been released by the Registrar.

REQUEST FOR CONSIDERATION BASED ON MEDICAL OR
COMPASSIONAL GROUNDS
As per Senate Bylaw 55, a student who wishes to receive consideration based on medical or compassionate
grounds should communicate with either the instructor or the Head of the AAU, or designate (e.g., program
coordinator), offering the course as soon as possible. The form, Graduate Request for Consideration (for
Health, Bereavement, or Extenuating Circumstances), should be completed and is available on the Office of the
Registrar Forms and Application for Students page applications).

A letter of rationale and supporting documents (e.g. the attending physician's letter) must be included. In such
cases, the Instructor may grant an aegrotat grade on the basis of term work or assign an "incomplete" grade
indicating what further work is required and the deadline by which such work must be completed. It is
recommended that at least 60% of the term work be completed in these cases. The instructor's response will
be forwarded by the Head of the AAU offering the course to the Dean of Graduate Studies who, on the
recommendation of the program and the Academic Standing Committee, may grant aegrotat standing in the
subject(s) concerned on the basis of the term mark, approve an Incomplete grade, grant permission for a
supplemental examination, or other accommodation.

ADMISSION LEVELS
An applicant may be admitted to a graduate program as a master's student, qualifying master's student,
transitional master's student, probationary Master's student or a PhD student.

Master's Qualifying Admission (M1): An applicant who holds a three-year degree in the discipline to which
s/he is applying, or a four-year degree in another discipline, may be admitted as a qualifying student, with a
recommendation for advancement to the M2 level contingent upon completion of a prescribed set of qualifying
courses, with a minimum grade as specified by the program. Since qualifying students are not candidates for a
degree, a qualifying student is not considered a graduate student.

Regular Admission (M2): Applicants who hold a four-year degree or equivalent in the discipline to which they
are seeking admission may be admitted to this level.

Transitional Admission (M2): An applicant who holds a four-year degree, but not one in the discipline to which
s/he is applying, may be admitted to a Master's program as a transitional student. Transitional students are
normally required to complete a program of no more than five (5) specified undergraduate courses in addition
to the graduate courses required of regular students. Upon completion of these extra courses, with a minimum
grade as specified by the program, the student may continue in the Master's program as a regular student.

Probationary Admission (M2): An applicant who does not meet the minimum departmental program
admission requirements, but who can present evidence of leadership, and/or substantial related work
experience, may be considered for probationary admission upon the recommendation of the program.
Students who are accepted on probation will be required to satisfactorily complete two specified graduate
courses in the first term, in addition to any other admission requirements, before conditions are waived.
Graduate credit will be given for the graduate courses after the conditions are waived. The final decision on
probationary admission rests with the Faculty of Graduate Studies

PhD Admission: Applicants who hold a Master's degree or, in exceptional cases, a four-year Bachelor's degree,
may be admitted to this level.




                                                                                                                23

REGISTRATION
REGISTRATION
Students whose applications for admission to graduate study have been approved for full- or part-time study
should present themselves to their program advisors prior to registration based on the Registrar's Important
Academic Dates.

CATEGORIES OF REGISTRATION
Categories of Registration includes definitions of "full-time graduate student" and "part-time graduate student"

It is the expectation that all graduate students are admitted on a full-time basis, although some programs may
offer part-time admission on an exceptional basis.

1. Full-Time Student: A student who is admitted to a program on a full-time basis is one who is geographically
available and visits the campus regularly. Graduate students must be continuously present at the university for
each term in which they are registered. It is understood that a graduate student may be absent from the
University while still under supervision, e.g., visiting libraries, attending a graduate course at another
institution, doing field work, etc. Any such absence from the University must be approved by the program.

2. Part-Time Student: Some graduate programs are available on a part-time basis, and students may be
admitted to such programs as part-time registrants. Students must petition the Graduate Program and Faculty
of Graduate Studies for permission to transfer to part-time status. Part-time registration in full-time programs
may be granted in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of both the Graduate Program and
Faculty of Graduate Studies. Supporting documentation must be submitted with the request. Students
interested in part-time studies should first consult the program.

Full-time employees of the University enrolled in graduate programs may only have part-time status.

Note: Part-time students may not take more than one course in any term. Concurrent registration in a course
and in a thesis or dissertation (not major paper) will be permitted.

GRADUATE REGISTRATION REGULATIONS
Graduate registration regulations include information on leaves of absence, non-degree registration and
auditing courses.

1. Graduate students must register before the appropriate deadline or they will not receive credit for academic
work they may be doing during the term. Note: Registration is not complete until the appropriate fees have
been paid.

Students completing all requirements for the degree within the first few weeks of a term may be eligible for a
tuition refund for that term. (Consult the Faculty of Graduate Studies.)

2. Full-time students are required to maintain continuous registration through all terms of their graduate
program. Failure to do so will require application for readmission to their program and payment may be
required for terms missed, up to a maximum of three terms.

                                                                                                                 24
Spring 2024 Academic Calendar
3. In accordance with the circumstances listed below, a student may apply to the Dean of Graduate Studies for,
and may be granted, a leave of absence.

Maternity Leave: Graduate students may request a maternity leave for no more than three consecutive terms
without prejudice to their academic standing. Time limit/funding eligibility will be extended by the duration of
the leave.

Paternity Leave: In recognition of a father's role, a graduate student may request paternity leave for no more
than one term without prejudice to their academic standing. Time limit/funding eligibility will be extended by
the duration of the leave.

Parental Leave: Parental leave is intended to recognize that there may be a need for a pause in studies in order
to provide full-time care in the first stages of parenting a child. Either or both parents may request one term of
leave without prejudice to their academic standing. The request for leave must be completed within twelve
months of the date of birth or custody. Time limit/funding eligibility will be extended by the duration of the
leave.

Financial Leave: In the case of financial necessity, primarily as evidenced by the support awarded through the
University, a student shall be granted a leave of no more than one term out of three upon application (not
available to part-time students.) Time limit/funding eligibility will not be extended by the duration of the leave.

Medical Leave: Graduate students may apply for a leave of absence on medical grounds for up to three terms
without prejudice to their academic standing. Students are required to provide documentation to support a
medical leave of absence. Time limit/funding eligibility will be extended by the duration of the leave.

Personal Leave: Graduate students may apply for a leave of absence on grounds of serious personal
circumstances for up to three terms Time limit/funding eligibility will be determined on a case-by-case basis.

A term is defined as a four-month period coinciding with the academic calendar (January to April; May to
August; and September to December).

While on leave, a student will not have access to any university resources, including office space, computer
access, library facilities, continuation of laboratory experiments, computer research applications, and guidance
by faculty members.

Apart from the combination of maternity or paternity and parental leave, sequentially combining two leave of
absence classifications is allowable only in special and extenuating circumstances.

Applications for a leave of absence must be submitted to the student's department for recommendation before
the end of the second week of the term. A student on leave of absence will be assessed a fee per term. Appeals
against any decisions shall be heard promptly by the Faculty of Graduate Studies.

4. Part-time students must register in every session in which the facilities of the University are to be utilized,
whether in residence or off-campus. This includes those who are consulting with faculty members while
working on a major paper, thesis, or dissertation. Part-time students who have not registered for more than
one terms will be required to apply for readmission, and their applications will be considered on their merits in
the light of the then prevailing conditions and circumstances.

5. Students are reminded that they will not receive credit for courses for which they are not properly registered
or for courses completed during terms in which the student has not paid fees.

                                                                                                                   25
Spring 2024 Academic Calendar
Once a student has registered, course changes or withdrawal after the published deadlines require permission
from the Dean of Graduate Studies. Subjects dropped without permission from the Dean will be regarded as
failures.

Non-Degree Registration: A student who is not interested in admission as a degree student may be allowed to
register for individual courses on a non-degree basis. The maximum number of courses taken overall on this
basis is two. Only students who have been admitted to a graduate program may receive graduate credit at the
University of Windsor for courses taken.

Audit Student: An audit student in any course is one who attends the course without credit toward a degree or
program. Such a student will not be allowed to write examinations and cannot be graded in any way. The
student will pay the regular fees for the course(s).



AWARDS AND FINANCIAL AID
ELIGIBILTY FOR GRADUATE FUNDING
Full-time graduate students in research-based programs may receive funding from three main sources:
scholarships (internal and external), Graduate Assistantships (GAs), and Research Assistantships (RAs). This
latter category is Department or even supervisor specific. Eligibility for the first two, scholarships and GAs, are
subject to constraints dictated by the funding sources and, in the case of GAs, by the Collective Agreement and
the Department.

One of the constraints upon funding eligibility is temporal and depends upon continuous registration. Support
from the University of Windsor at the Master's level may be offered within the first two years (six terms) from
the first term of registration at the Master’s level (M2). Support from the University of Windsor at the Doctoral
level may be offered within the first four years (twelve terms) from the first term of registration at the Doctoral
level (D2). While external awards are administered according to rules defined by the source agencies, and these
can differ slightly from program to program, their rules regarding eligibility are similar to the above listed.

In order to retain support once it is awarded, students must maintain continuous full-time registration; rare
exceptions can be made to accommodate a Leave of Absence for medical, maternity or paternity leave. Where
leave is granted for other reasons, the term(s) on leave will diminish the number of terms that a student was
eligible to receive support.

Failure to register by the posted late registration deadline for each semester will result in forfeiture of support
for that semester. Students who are eligible to apply for external awards are obliged to do so, or they may
forfeit their funding from the University of Windsor.

For up-to-date detailed information on the funding available to graduate students, please refer to the website
of the Faculty of Graduate Studies at www.uwindsor.ca/graduate.

principles of learning and teaching will be introduced that are appropriate to the university classroom.
Educational research will guide the approach taken in the course and will be used as the theoretical basis for
course content. This course is a non-credit course and, upon successful completion, will appear on the student's
transcript.

CTLP-8100. Learning-Centred Teaching in Higher Education
This course offers the opportunity to explore and evaluate the principles and theories of learning-centred
teaching in higher education. Through a diverse range of class activities, readings, reflection, and peer-reviewed
class facilitation, students will develop skills in teaching critical thinking; mentorship; and active learning.
Students will also use research findings and reflection on teaching practice to inform their own teaching
development. This course is of particular interest to graduate students and instructors, but prior teaching
experience in higher education is not a prerequisite. (Prerequisite: Admission into a graduate program or
faculty status.)

CTLP-8200. Course Design

representative of those currently being used or developed by researchers in the field.

CASJ-8502. Research Methods
This course provides an overview of a range of contemporary research methods in media/communication
studies. Students will develop skills to evaluate the appropriateness of methods for different research
purposes, critically review extant scholarly literature, and examine the ethics and politics of the research
process.

CASJ-8512.Communication and Social Movements
This course draws upon an array of relevant theoretical perspectives to examine how traditional and non-
traditional forms of communication/media have been used within, and by, a variety of social movements.
Students will explore the contribution of new/emerging communication technologies/platforms to social
activism and social movements; representations of social movements in the context of
political/economic/social change; the diversity and importance of alternative media as a central component in
movements for social justice.

CASJ-8513.History of Communication Thought and Technology
This course examines the historical development of communication technology from a variety of approaches
including western philosophy, critical political economy, gender studies, anti-colonialism, science and
technology studies (STS), and dependency theory, among others. Communication thought from the Greeks to
the present will be analyzed to develop a broader critique of dominant power relations and inequitable access
to technological resources.

CASJ-8514. Political Economy of Media and Communication
The course examines the historical and intellectual roots of critical political economy and explores
contemporary applications of this theoretical approach. Students will analyze how media are implicated in the
power relations and structural inequalities that underpin the capitalist economy as well as how they may
function as sites of resistance and activism. Topics may include analyses of media platforms, ownership
structures, labour, policy and regulation, privacy and surveillance issues, and media representation.

CASJ-8515 Topics in Cultural Studies
This course surveys the historical and intellectual foundations of cultural studies and explores the
contemporary relevance of this approach to understanding media and popular culture. Any range of media
genres, texts, practices, institutions, signifying systems, and circuits of production/consumption may be
examined in terms of their aesthetics, representational and cultural politics, power dynamics, and ideological
underpinnings.

CASJ-8518. City as Media
The seminar will explore theoretical approaches to the ways in which urban spaces, everyday life, and city
stories are articulated and imagined through media, arts and technologies. Seminar participants will develop
research papers and experience-based creative projects about Windsor and/or Detroit. Students will examine
films, stories, sounds and other media objects that reflect the urban, but will also be encouraged to develop
research methodologies that use old and new media to question and document the cities’ urban and suburban
life. In classroom seminars, a range of theoretical writings and media objects all oriented to the urban will be
discussed. In research practice, students will work with techniques such as auto-ethnographies to develop
creative documents around everyday urban life. (3-hour lecture.)

Bibliography, and Language and Linguistics;

4. Additional courses from any of the above areas to make up the total number of courses required for a four-
year English BA.

Students who do not have a four-year B.A. or its equivalent may be admitted to the Faculty of Graduate Studies
in a qualifying (M1) program. In such a program, the student is expected to register in appropriate
undergraduate courses in order to satisfy the requirements above. Alternatively, students who are deficient in
any of the stated requirements for admission may be invited or may request to write a qualifying examination
(see below, "Qualifying or Placement Examination").

Students who are admitted to the Faculty of Graduate Studies in the MA program will be expected to select
courses in their first year to complete the requirements specified above.

In addition to the documents required, applicants must submit a "Proposal of Studies" (about 500 words) with
their applications indicating the program and option to which they are applying and discussing such issues as
their areas of academic or creative interest, their undergraduate training, and their academic or career goals.
Students applying to the field in Creative Writing must submit, with their application, a portfolio of
representative creative work (20-25 pages). Students with a four-year B.A. in English may apply to either of the
fields and to any of the options. Students with interdisciplinary interests, with honours degrees combining
English with another discipline, or with abilities or backgrounds that do not correspond to the particular
requirements for admission listed above, but who have an overall average of 80%, apply to either field but may
be required to take additional courses.

Qualifying or Placement Examination: An applicant for admission to the Candidate year for the Master's degree
who is deficient in any of the stated requirements for admission to this level of graduate study may be invited,
or may request, to write a qualifying examination. A similar examination is available as a placement test, on the
basis of which students in the two-year MA program may be granted advanced standing.

Students from other universities may arrange to take these examinations in other centres provided the
program coordinator is notified well in advance.

Counselling: Students admitted to one of the fields of the MA program in English will be assigned a faculty
advisor who will be available to counsel them on all aspects of their work. The program coordinator (or a
delegate) must approve a student's program of study before registration.

Grades: After admission to candidacy, graduate students in the MA program in English must maintain at least a
70% average, but graduate credit is given only at the 80% and 70% level. A student whose grade in a graduate
course is less than 70% may be allowed to repeat the course or to substitute another for it, at the discretion of
the Dean of Graduate Studies and the program coordinator. The student may not repeat more than one course.


ENGLISH AND CREATIVE WRITING COURSES
All graduate courses are seminars. Enrolment is limited in these courses, because considerable contribution is
expected from each member of the seminar. For such courses, the corresponding undergraduate survey
course, or an acceptable equivalent, is ordinarily a prerequisite. This condition may be waived only by
agreement of both the program coordinator and the professor offering the seminar. The specific topics of
individual courses may vary, depending upon the interests and needs of professors and students. It is thus
impossible to list in detail the many topics that may from time to time be offered. The schedule below lists only
the major periods or forms of literature in which special topics courses may be available. Special topics courses
                                                                                                                32

HISTORY
PROGRAMS
Master’s in History (MA)
Admission Requirements
The normal requirement for admission to the MA program is an honours degree in History, with at least a 75%
major average in undergraduate History courses. Students with an honours degree in fields other than History
will be considered on the basis of their academic background and standing, and may be required to complete
extra undergraduate courses as part of their program. Students with a three-year degree will be required to
complete a full year (ten courses) of undergraduate courses (Masters Qualifying -- see section titled Application
Procedures – Admission Levels).

Program Requirements
Students must successfully complete six courses and a Major Paper. Students must take two required courses:
HIST-8030 and HIST-8040 as well as four more History graduate courses. A student may, with the consent of the
Graduate Advisor or AAU Head, take one course in another University of Windsor graduate program or in
History at Wayne State University. Students usually complete the coursework in their first two semesters. The
Major Paper will normally be written under the supervision of two History faculty members.

Although it is possible for students to complete the master’s program in one calendar year (three terms in
residence), many students complete in 4-5 semesters.


HISTORY COURSES
All of the following courses will not necessarily be offered in any one year.

HIST-8030.Modes of Historical Interpretation
This course introduces students to a variety of methods and theories currently used to advance historical
explanation. Particular attention will be paid to the role of narrative, the place of the social sciences, and the
complexities of race, gender, ethnicity, and class in historical writing. Readings will also address the problem of
synthesis, post-modernism and the relationship between history and public policy. This course also stresses the
development of skills in critical reading and analytical writing.

HIST-8040. Research Methods
This course introduces students to the range of methods and approaches to historical research, and to the
problems associated with interpreting various kinds of sources. Students will identify and establish a research
problem, in which they define the questions to be posed, and begin to move from broad to narrow approaches
to their topic. They will discover and evaluate accessible sources of evidence, and at the same time develop an
appropriate methodological and interpretive framework for a specific research project.

HIST-8060. Studies in the History of Sexuality
This course will provide a thematic approach to the foundations of Western attitudes towards sexuality,
especially as they developed in premodern Europe. The complex interweaving of ancient ideas, medicine,
Christian law and theology, and popular practices and beliefs will be explored. This course is problem oriented
and will explore some of the theoretical issues pertaining to the historical study of human sexuality.

                                                                                                                  35
Spring 2024 Academic Calendar
HIST-8070. Studies in the History of Women and Gender
This course examines the historiography and theory of these two interrelated fields since 1970. It explores the
themes and approaches in early studies of women's organizations, labour, and sexuality; the later growth of
attention to differences of culture and power among women; and the more recent emergence of
poststructuralism and the study of the interrelation of gender, class, and race. Readings will range across time
periods and national boundaries but with an emphasis on the U.S. literature.

HIST-8080. Studies in the History of the Book and the Culture of the Written Word
This course will provide an introduction to the historical problems encountered and interpretive possibilities
revealed when books (both artefacts and texts) become the focus of inquiry. Ranging broadly through a variety
of disciplinary approaches to manuscript and print cultures on both sides of the Atlantic, we will consider such
questions as the complex uses of literacy, and the extent to which technological transformations such as the
printing press or the computer have determined literary and cultural change. Studies of the book trades
(printing, bookselling, journalism, publishing of all kinds) will be used to illuminate changes in religious,
scientific, scholarly, literary and other aspects of the cultures (from medieval to postmodern) in which they
flourish.

HIST-8090. Studies in Canadian Social History
The course discusses approaches, methods, and debates in the writing of social history in English Canada since
1970. Topics discussed include historiographical debates over the writing of a "national" history, the writing of
labour and working-class history, women's history, ethnic and immigration history, the history of sexuality,
regional history, and family history. How the categories of class, gender, race, ethnicity and sexuality have been
incorporated into the writing of Canadian social history is a focus of consideration.

HIST-8100. Studies in Postcolonial History
This course evaluates important works of history and theory written from a postcolonial perspective. It focuses
on novel approaches to studying people whose modern experience began as subordinate subjects of the West's
colonizing projects. The course will also consider the influence of postcolonial scholarship on contemporary
historiography in general. (2 lecture hours a week.)

HIST-8110. Modernity
This course address’s themes in the history of modernity, the lived experience of the capitalist, scientific and
technological revolutions over the last three hundred years. Focusing primarily on the years from 1800-1950s,
this course will begin with literature on the contemporary ideas of “being modern” in North America and
Europe and the critiques of modernity by social theorists such as Marx, Gramsci and Weber. It will then turn to
the historical literature on modernity, ideas of the modern and their impact on areas such as politics, the state,
the workplace, economic development, education, colonial relationships, the environment.

HIST-8130. Class in the Anglo Atlantic
This course addresses the ways in which the concept of class has influenced our understanding of the past,
particularly in relation to the history of working people. It reviews the "new" labour history that emerged in
British and North American history beginning in the 1960s, and documents the ways in which the history of
identities (race, ethnicity and gender) and postmodernism have impacted the study of class. The course
examines the rise of capital and labour from their roots on the farm and plantation and in the craft shop
through to modern industrial society and the contemporary effects of deindustrialization and globalization. The
course furthermore scrutinizes not only the history of that experience but also the theoretical and
historiographical content of class studies. (2 lecture hours a week.)

PHILOSOPHY
PROGRAMS
Master of Philosophy (MA)
The aim of the program is to give students the opportunity to deepen their philosophical understanding both
by broadening their undergraduate background and/or by allowing them to concentrate their studies in one of
the two specific areas of focus in our program. One area is informal logic, the theory of argument, and the
theory of critical thinking; the other area is twentieth-century continental philosophy and critical social theory.
It is expected that theses and major papers will be written in one of these two areas. The possibility of
concentrating in some other area exists but is conditional upon staffing resources, which are subject to change.
The Philosophy MA program is structured in such a way as to encourage maximum participation by students in
seminars and to allow extensive contact with professors outside of formal class time.

Admission Requirements
See the admissions section of the Graduate Calendar for general requirements for admission into an MA
program at the University of Windsor. The Philosophy program normally requires a BA honours in Philosophy or
its equivalent for regular admission to the Master's program (M-2 admission level) and a general BA in
Philosophy or its equivalent for admission to the qualifying stream of the Master's program (M-1 admission
level). Students are admitted to either the coursework or the major paper stream

Program Requirements
For general requirements for the Master's degree, see section titled, The Master's Degree Program
Requirements. The following are particular requirements for the MA in Philosophy:

1. The student may proceed to the degree in any one of the following ways:

(a) The major paper stream
Students admitted to the major paper stream must successfully complete six graduate courses, including the
Departmental Seminar (PHIL 8900), pass the MA examination, and write a major research paper (PHIL 8960). A
maximum of two courses may be taken from a cognate field.

(b) The coursework stream
Students admitted to the coursework stream must successfully complete eight graduate courses, including the
Departmental Seminar (PHIL 8900), and pass the MA examination. A maximum of two courses may be taken
from a cognate field.

Students who wish to move from the coursework stream to the major paper stream must satisfy the following
conditions: (i) complete at least six graduate courses (two of these courses may be in a cognate field), including
the Departmental Seminar (PHIL 8900), with a minimum average of 80%; (ii) pass the MA examination; (iii)
submit to the Graduate Coordinator a major research paper plan that was approved by the academic
supervisor.

(c) The thesis stream
Students who wish to move from the coursework stream or the major paper stream to the thesis stream must
satisfy the following conditions: (i) complete at least four graduate courses in philosophy, including the
Departmental Seminar (PHIL 8900), with a minimum average of 85%; (ii) pass the MA examination; (iii) submit

                                                                                                                 38
Spring 2024 Academic Calendar
to the Graduate Coordinator a thesis plan that was approved by the academic supervisor. In addition to
satisfying these conditions, students in this stream must also write a thesis (PHIL 8970).

2. All students proceeding to the degree must pass the MA examination following the successful completion of
the Departmental Seminar (PHIL 8900). In the event of a failing grade, students will be provided an opportunity
to retake the exam before completing the first year of their program. Students who fail the MA examination for
a second time will be asked to withdraw from the program.

3. MA Qualifying Year (M-1 admission): Students at the I Master's level are required to take PHIL-4910 (Honours
Seminar) (see section titled, Philosophy Courses in the Undergraduate Calendar).

4. Program Approval: Each student must have his or her projected program approved by the Graduate
Coordinator.

Argumentation Studies (PhD)
As of Fall 2023, there are no new admissions to this program.

The program provides expertise in the history, methods, and applications of argumentation scholarship as this
interdisciplinary field has developed in the last six decades. Argumentation is defined as collaborative or
competitive reasoning through verbal or visual means by which people strive to persuade others on any topic
where information, knowledge, or claims conflict or are inconsistent. Different ways for analyzing and
evaluating people’s arguments address the methods and principles that may be involved, and provide the core
subject matter for Argumentation Studies. This will include some attention to policy agendas, interpersonal
reasoning, and individual cognition.

Admission Requirements
Students identified for the program will specify which research cluster they wish to work with or detail a
project that can be assigned to one of the clusters. This interest should be communicated in a personal
statement provided by each student. The members of that cluster will give advice to the program’s steering
committee of the student’s suitability with respect to their background and their intended research. This
decision will be based on the statement, their CV and letters of reference. Given the interdisciplinary nature of
the program, we would not expect a common background, so decisions will be made on the basis of past
performance and letters of reference. Students will also be expected to have achieved a Master’s degree (or
equivalent professional experience) with an 80% or higher standing. Appropriate Master’s programs for
admission would include English or Communication Studies (with an emphasis on rhetoric), Rhetoric (with an
emphasis on rhetorical theory or debate), Psychology (with an emphasis on reasoning, or bias), Computer
Science (with an emphasis on modelling artificial intelligence), Law (with an interest in dimensions of evidence),
Political Science (with an emphasis on conflict resolution or political reasoning), Philosophy (with an emphasis
on informal logic), Linguistics (with an emphasis on discourse analysis), or Women’s Studies (with an emphasis
on gender bias and reasoning).

Equivalent professional experience will be assessed in terms of its relevance to Argumentation Studies and
presence of background knowledge required for success on the planned project. But all admitted students will
have to have shown evidence in their application that they have the requisite requirements for success in the
program in terms of both their past education and having experience in a profession (such as law or policy
analysis) that uses principles and methods characteristic of our program. The student’s Advisory Committee will
be drawn from the Research Cluster with which he or she is associated with on admission.

The supervisory committee will determine the number of qualifying graduate courses (if any, to a maximum of
three) and students will be informed of these requirements as part of their offer of admission.

                                                                                                                39
Spring 2024 Academic Calendar
Program of Study
Within the first term of the student's registration, his/her Advisory Committee will be formed except for the
external examiner, who will be appointed during the final year of a student's study and research (unless the
student’s Advisory Committee wishes to bring the external in at the proposal stage). The Advisory Committee
will be chosen in the manner detailed in Section PhD Program Requirements of the University of Windsor’s
Graduate Calendar and consist of the following members as a minimum: an independent examiner external to
the university (chosen at the time of the proposal or prior to the final defence), one member from the
university faculty but outside of the Argumentation Studies Graduate Program, and three Argumentation
Studies Graduate Program members, drawn from the appropriate Research Cluster. The external examiner
must be a Full or Associate Professor with expertise in the area being examined and a proven research record.
He/she must be impartial to both the student’s supervisor and the student. The Dean of the Faculty of
Graduate Studies will choose the external examiner on the recommendation of the Argumentation Studies
Graduate Program Steering Committee. The external examiner will normally attend the defence and submit a
written report on the dissertation to the Dean of Graduate Studies. The final oral defence will be chaired by a
designate of the Dean of Graduate Studies.

Degree Requirements
ARGU-9000. History and Theories of Argumentation
ARGU-9010. Advanced Studies in Argumentation
ARGU-9980. Dissertation

Students must successfully complete History of Theories of Argumentation and Advanced Studies in
Argumentation. However, in order to progress from fall to winter students must have a 77% average. The
courses will be led by the Directors of the program with full faculty involvement on a rotating basis. The courses
will be graded in accordance with university standards. All PhD students who have successfully completed the
course with a minimum grade of 77% will be expected to attend the courses as auditors in a subsequent year of
their program. Requirements to complete the degree are the two multi-disciplinary graduate seminar courses;
preparation and defence of a Research Proposal; preparation and defence of an original dissertation.

Oral Qualifying Exam
Students will successfully complete during the first two years of enrolment in the program, an oral qualifying
exam, administered by the student’s Advisory Committee. Students will be required to possess comprehensive
knowledge of their field of study as well as any ancillary fields relevant to the dissertation topic (as determined
in advance by the Advisory Committee). It is in terms of ensuring success in this requirement that some
students may be directed to take supplementary courses. Students will be evaluated on a satisfactory,
unsatisfactory basis. Should a student be unsuccessful in the first attempt at the oral qualifying exam, they will
be provided a detailed assessment by their committee and have the opportunity to take a second exam within
six months. Students must be judged satisfactory on this background exam before completing their research
proposal.

Dissertation
Students must successfully complete and defend a Research Proposal. The dissertation proposal is submitted to
and evaluated by the student’s Advisory Committee, including the faculty member from another program.
Students are evaluated on a pass, fail basis. They will be required to submit a Research Progress Report to the
Advisory Committee annually and meet with the committee every six months to discuss progress and research
plans.

Following this, students must complete an original research project reported in a dissertation. They must then
defend the dissertation in a public lecture before the Advisory Committee, including external members.


                                                                                                                  40

beginning with the Ancient Greeks and proceeding through the twentieth century, and part introduction to
further research agendas in the field. The course involves in-depth readings and discussions of seminal texts in
the field, including such figures as Aristotle, Toulmin, Perelman, Hamblin, Walton, and van Eemeren. There is
intensive reading involved, and students will be expected to demonstrate (through discussion and papers) a
thorough understanding of this core material. (6.0 credit)

ARGU-9010. Advanced Studies in Argumentation
This course, offered in the Winter term each year, will introduce students to different fields of current research
in argumentation studies as conducted by members of the faculty. Themes may include ‘Feminism and
Argumentation’, ‘Argumentation in Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence’, ‘Advances in Multi-modal
Argumentation,’ among others. Reading lists will depend on the topics involved each year. (Prerequisite: 14-
ARGU-9000 History and Theories of Argumentation) (6.0 credit)

ARGU-9980. Dissertation Research
Students work with a supervisor and committee to develop and implement an original research investigation,
informed by the training in Argumentation Studies provided by the coursework and Qualifying Examination.
The results will be embodied in a professionally organized and written dissertation conforming to the
requirements outlined in the Graduate Calendar for the Argumentation Studies program and by the Faculty of
Graduate Studies. The dissertation is expected to be of the highest quality and suitable for publication (Graded
pass/fail). (Prerequisites: ARGU-9000 and ARGU-9010; passing Qualifying Exam.)

of the instructor. (May be repeated for credit if content changes and with permission of the instructor.)

PHIL-8260. Philosophy of Law
The objective of this course is to introduce the student to contemporary issues concerning the philosophy of
law, to include European and Indigenous law. Particular emphasis will be placed upon the presupposed relation
of concepts to society. The course will examine such issues as the difference and relation of legitimacy to
legality, the relation of legal analysis to social needs, the relation of morality and ethicality to the content of
legal rules and legal reasoning (Prerequisite: MA Philosophy students or by instructor permission) (Cross-listed
with PHIL-4260.)

PHIL-8300. Topics in Gender and Sexuality
The course will focus on the philosophical implications of the impact gender and sexuality have on major
epistemological, scientific, normative, and political problems. The specific focus of each year's class will be
determined by the instructor. (May be repeated for credit if content changes and with permission of the
instructor.)

PHIL-8500. Topics in Mind or Knowledge

PHIL-8600. Movements and Figures in Argumentation Theory and Informal Logic

PSYCHOLOGY
PROGRAMS
Clinical Psychology (MA and PhD)
Applied Social Psychology (MA and PhD)
General Information
The graduate programs of study are Adult Clinical Psychology, Child Clinical Psychology, Clinical
Neuropsychology, and Applied Social Psychology. All graduate students in Psychology are required to comply
with the most recent ethical principles, values, and standards of the Canadian Psychological Association and the
American Psychological Association, and with the current standards for research with human subjects adopted
by the University of Windsor. Failure of a student to adhere to the principles, values, and standards defined
above will constitute sufficient cause to warrant dismissal from the graduate program in Psychology.

Doctor of Philosophy Degree
The first phase of the doctoral program involves the completion of the Master's degree in the first two years of
the program. Applied Social students may be admitted to the PhD program with a Master’s degree from an
outside institution. In the case that their previous Master’s degree is not from the field of Applied Social
Psychology, the Area will determine what courses are needed to supplement their missing background
preparation (as specified at admission).

Psychology Fields Include:
MA and PhD in Psychology (Adult Clinical, Child Clinical, Clinical Neuropsychology)
MA and PhD in Psychology (Applied Social Psychology)

In addition to the general requirements, the following requirements must be met by all students proceeding to
the PhD degree.

Admission Requirements
Applicants with a four-year undergraduate psychology degree or its equivalent will be considered for
admission.

Applicants will be assessed with respect to their academic qualifications including grades. Possession of the
minimum academic requirements does not ensure acceptance. Applications for admission must be completed
by December 1.

Program Requirements
1) Master's degree: The first phase of the doctoral program involves the completion of the Master's degree in
the first two years of the program, the requirements for which include a thesis. Further advancement in the
doctoral program depends on the quality of performance in fulfilling the requirements for the Master's degree.
This would not apply to students entering the Applied Social Psychology PhD program with a prior Master’s
degree.

2) Course Work: Requirements vary according to areas of specialization, however, there is a core curriculum
involving two general statistical methodology courses, a methodology course in the student's area of

                                                                                                                48

specialization, and a course in ethical and professional issues in psychology. All students are required to take at
least one course that places considerable emphasis on cultural, cross-cultural, or multicultural issues. All
students in the Clinical Program must demonstrate competence in the four core areas of biological bases of
behaviour, cognitive bases of behaviour, social bases of behaviour, and the historical and philosophical
foundations of psychology. Up to six courses may be accepted for credit from another university. Together with
the above requirements, students must complete an internship. The clinical internship is approximately 2000
hours and the applied social internship is approximately 1000 hours.

3) Academic Advisor: Each student is assigned an academic advisor at the beginning of his, her, or their first
year of graduate studies.

4) Doctoral Committee: Research undertaken as part of a doctoral program is directed by a doctoral
committee. The membership of the doctoral committee must be appointed by the Head of the Department and
approved by the Executive Committee of the Faculty Council of Graduate Studies. When the student is deemed
ready to undertake such research, he or she proposes the name of a research advisor and, in consultation with
the proposed advisor, the names of other members of the committee consisting of at least two other members
of the Psychology Department and one extra-departmental member of faculty. For the defense of the
dissertation, an external examiner will be selected by the doctoral committee, subject to the approval of the
Department Head and the Dean of Graduate Studies. The external examiner is from outside of the University of
Windsor and is nationally or internationally recognized as having expertise in the area of psychology in which
the candidate's research is carried out. The external examiner shall not participate in the direction of the
research project but will appraise the dissertation and ordinarily will be present at the final oral examination
(see below, 6).

5) Dissertation: The principal requirement for the PhD. degree in Psychology is the presentation of a
dissertation which embodies the results of an original investigation. The results so presented should constitute
a significant and original contribution to knowledge.

6) Examinations: In addition to examinations in courses, the student must meet the following requirements:
Comprehensive Examination: After completion of all course requirements (with the exception of internship
courses), the student must pass a comprehensive examination in his or her area of specialization. Successful
completion of the examination admits the student to candidacy for the PhD. degree. If a student fails the
comprehensive examination, he or she may retake the examination once only at the discretion of the Head of
the Department and the Dean of Graduate Studies.

Final Examination: Each candidate will, on the recommendation of his or her doctoral committee, submit to a
final oral examination in defense of the dissertation.

Master of Business Administration/Juris Doctor (MBA/JD)
This special program provides students interested in a career combining management and legal skills with an
opportunity to complete the MBA and JD. degrees in four years. The program is jointly administrated by
representatives of the Odette School of Business, the Faculty of Law, and the Faculty of Graduate Studies.

Admission Requirements
The admission procedure for the integrated program consists of two stages. At the first stage, students
applying to the program must meet the admission requirements of both the MBA and JD programs. Therefore,
separate applications must be submitted to the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Graduate Studies for
admission to the regular degree program in Law and the MBA. To facilitate academic and career planning, it is
strongly suggested that these applications be made simultaneously. Students who are accepted to both the
MBA and JD programs will be accepted to the integrated program and will proceed to attend first year in either
Faculty. Such students will be granted a deferred admission to the other Faculty in the program. This special
deferred admission will be revoked if the applicant's performance in the first program fails to meet the first-
year academic standards of the program. In such case the applicant may re-apply for regular admission to the
second-degree program. Applications will also be considered for entry to the program from candidates who are
attending the first year of either the JD or MBA. programs. They must meet the admissions requirements and
application deadline for the program for which they are seeking entry.

For information on Application to the integrated MBA/JD visit the Faculty of Law at:
http://www.uwindsor.ca/law/344/how-apply-mbajd.

TERM PLANNING
The MBA/JD Program offers students the opportunity to experience two enriching education experiences, two
degrees, in an accelerated, integrated manner.

MBA/JD students can enter into the program in one of two ways:
i) Defer law studies for one year, complete 15 course credits toward the MBA (with only the Major Paper (BUSI-
8960), weighted at two course credits, remaining for completion) and then study Law in the regular manner for
three years.
ii) Complete Year 1 of law studies and take a one-year leave of absence from Law. Once at the Odette School of
Business, complete 15 course credits toward the MBA (again, with only the Major Paper (BUSI-8960) remaining
for completion) and then return to Law and study in the regular manner for the remaining two years.

Option (i) is preferred because it allows the student to study with a cohort in both programs; however, students
interested in the MBA who have completed only the first year of Law at the University of Windsor will have no
problem completing the requirements in the two remaining years of study.

The sequence of courses would be identical to those studied by all MBA students, with one exception. With
earning the 15 MBA. course credits, only the major paper (again, worth the equivalent of two courses) would
remain to complete the program. The sequence is presented below:

+ BUSI-8960 Major Paper (for MBA/JD students only)

To complete the two degrees, as stated, students commence (or return to) law studies in September. They are
registered in Law and finish the remaining two or three years of the program (whichever is applicable). During
the final year of Law studies (likely in the winter semester), the students will also submit and present their
major papers. Once completed, a grade is assigned for the Major Paper and the 17 course credits required for
the MBA are fulfilled.

The registration of students is straightforward. While studying for the core 15 course credits of the MBA., all
students are registered full-time in the MBA (from September until August). However, when they return to Law
the following autumn, the students will revert to full-time Law. They will complete the Major Paper (BUSI-8960)
under that status, using the MBA/JD program status in UWinsite. Once completed, the Major Paper (BUSI-8960)
will have its “IP” status converted to the grade that was earned.

Master of Business Administration/Doctor of Medicine (MBA/MD)
(Concurrent Program with Schulich School of Medicine)
Admission Requirements
The admission procedure for the integrated program consists of two stages. At the first stage, students apply to
the Doctor of Medicine Program at the Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University. Upon
acceptance, students would be required to complete their first year of studies. At the second stage, students
would apply to the course-based MBA program at the University of Windsor. Therefore, separate applications
must be submitted to Schulich Medicine at Western and to the Faculty of Graduate Studies at the University of
Windsor for admission to the regular degree programs in both the MD and the MBA. Students who are
accepted to both the MD and MBA programs will automatically be accepted to the integrated program. After
completing their first year in the MD program, students will take a one-year leave of absence after the second
or third year of MD studies to complete their MBA, before returning to the MD program.

Term Planning
The MBA/MD Program offers students the opportunity to experience two enriching education experiences, two
degrees, in an accelerated, integrated manner.


                                                                                                              89

MBA/MD students can enter into the MBA program by deferring medicine studies for one year, complete 15
course credits toward the MBA and the Major Paper (BUSI-8960), weighted at two course credits, and then
study Medicine in the regular manner.

The sequence of courses would be identical to those studied by all MBA students, with one exception (noted in
italics). With earning the 15 M.B.A. course credits, only the major paper (again, worth the equivalent of two
courses) would remain to complete the program. The sequence is presented below:

Having met all the MBA requirements, students would then return to medicine studies in September. They are
registered in medicine and finish the remainder of the MD Program.

The MBA Major Paper (BUSI-8960) for the purposes of the MBA/MD is to be completed under the supervisor of
an Odette faculty member who is a member of the Faculty of Graduate Studies (FGS). Second committee
members may be from medicine if they members of FGS. Generally, the required second committee member
will also be an Odette faculty member who is a member of FGS. The MBA Major Paper (BUSI-8960) must follow
requirements from FGS and includes a public defense.

Please note that the MD program offered at the University of Windsor is a regional campus for the Schulich
School of Medicine & Dentistry at the University of Western Ontario. The idea for a joint program was initially
proposed by the Associate Dean of the Windsor Campus of the Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, Dr
Larry Jacobs. Consultations and support were also obtained from Schulich Windsor Campus Manager of
Medical Education, Anne Mullen, and the Vice Dean (Acting) of Undergraduate Medical Education, Dr Gary
Tithecott, at Western University.

Schulich Medicine & Dentistry MD Program has a stream that supports academic enrichment named “MD+”.
The MD + stream has a goal of creating interdisciplinary, experiential learning environments and offering a wide
spectrum of opportunities for a parallel graduate studies. There are over a dozen MD+ partnerships being made
available to Schulich Medicine MD Program Leaners, including thesis-based and course-based Master degree
opportunities with a variety of Western University faculties. The proposed MBA-MD Program is a natural
addition to a well-tested and popular stream of studies offered by Western University.

The structure for this new combined program was jointly agreed upon by both Odette and Schulich. The
current structure is consistent with other MD+ offerings at Schulich and is the same as the current JD/MBA
program at Odette.

The MD program will be offered as is by Western University

In exceptional circumstances, applicants with lower formal academic qualifications but with a strong track
record of professional experience related to the proposed area of doctoral study may be admitted. In these
cases, however, the Admissions Committee may place additional requirements upon the applicant. Additional
requirements will be stated on the offer of admission.

Applicants must provide evidence of research competence normally demonstrated by a master's thesis.

English is the primary language of communication and instruction in the program. Applicants from other
countries who have not completed a degree at a university where the primary language of instruction is English
must pass the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) with a minimum score of 600 (250 computer-
based) or an equivalent demonstration of proficiency. Candidates who are working on the degree at a distance
from the home university must purchase the software and access to the internet which will enable them to
participate fully in the required courses.

Admission and Advanced Standing
Students may receive advance credit for a maximum of one-half course specialization at the graduate level
provided that this course has not been credited to a degree or certificate already awarded, is relevant to the
proposed area of study and has been taken within three years of admission. Requests for advanced credit must
be declared prior to admission. No substitution may be made for Core Seminars I and II or the Joint
Specialization course via distance education.

Research Plan
Applicants must submit a description of their proposed area of research (approximately 2-3 typed pages).
When an applicant meets the basic requirements for admission, the potential supervisor and/or the Program
Director will assist the applicant in developing a plan of study which will be presented to the Program
Committee for approval. If approved, the applicant will proceed to register as a doctoral student at the home
university of the dissertation supervisor and will be subject to the general degree regulations of that university.
The offer of admission will be made to the applicant by the home university.

Dissertation supervisors will be required to report candidates' progress annually to the Program Committee
and to appropriate authorities at the participating universities. Normally, candidates will be expected to
complete course requirements and the comprehensive portfolio, and to submit a research proposal within
three years of their initial registration. Changes to the approved plan of study must be approved in advance by
the Program Director in consultation with the candidate and the supervisor.

Fields of Study
1) Cognition and Learning: Cognition and learning draws primarily upon cognitive, developmental, social, and
educational psychology as well as science and technology, to examine critically the cognitive, behavioural,
emotional, and social processes of educators and students as they engage in teaching and learning. Integral
components of this field include, but are not limited to, issues concerning best practices, remedial and
contemporary instruction, assessment and evaluation, professional development, curriculum development and
implementation, metacognition, and learning theories.

2) Educational Leadership and Policy Studies: This field of study encompasses a range of humanities and social
science disciplines to explore the morale, social, and cultural purposes of educational organizations, policy, and
leadership. It draws upon the works of key scholars in organizational, administrative and policy studies to
articulate the philosophical, theoretical and methodological frameworks that inform scholarship and practice.
These frameworks situate the major issues and debates confronting educational systems within their larger
socio-political and socio-cultural contexts.


                                                                                                                111
Spring 2024 Academic Calendar
3) Social/Cultural/Political Contexts of Education: Education occurs in a dynamic, complex, and contested
milieu. The Social/Cultural/Political Contexts of Education field of study critically explores the interplay
between culture and education from caried historical, philosophical, and theoretical perspectives with the
intent of fostering emancipatory research and democratic practice. Consideration is given but not limited to
social constructs of race, class, gender, sexuality, and ability/disability, and how they intersect and influence
educational experiences.

Applicants to the program must declare a field of study prior to admission to the program.

Degree Requirements
Doctoral candidates must be familiar with the academic regulations governing graduate studies at the home
university.

(a) Doctoral Seminar I (EDUC-9020) and Doctoral Seminar II (EDUC-9040)

practice in contexts typical of higher education. Analysis and reflection on teaching practice constitutes a
central theme of learning in the course. The course is of particular interest to teaching assistants and members
of the professoriate from across the disciplines and professional fields, but prior teaching experience in higher
education is not a prerequisite.

EDUC-8030. The Psychology of Learning and Teaching
This course will provide students with an in-depth view of psychological theory and research towards the
understanding of learning and teaching. While both behavioural and cognitive perspectives will be discussed,
the emphasis will be upon cognitive theory and application. Topics will include behaviourism, behaviour
modification, information processing, metacognition, cognitive behaviour modification, cognitive strategy
training, motivation and individual differences.

EDUC-8150. Comparative and International Education
The course is designed to introduce students, who are registered in both the Educational Administration and
Leadership and Curriculum stream of the MEd program, to important educational issues from a comparative
and international perspective. Within this framework, the similarities and differences between Canadian
education and educational practices in other countries of the world are examined. Key questions that guide the
direction of the course include, although are not limited to the following: what can we learn from the
educational, teaching and learning practices of other countries? What are the processes involved in educational
policy formulation from an international perspective? What are the emerging global trends in education and
how does globalization impact on education and teaching/learning practices in Canada? In addition, various
international frameworks for promoting peaceful educational/school environments such as peace education,
global, and intercultural education are explored. The local, national and global impact of the educational
policies of international agencies such as the UN, UNESCO, the World Bank, and CIDA are also analyzed.

groups in educational settings. Attention will be given to the implications of such theory and research for
administration in educational institutions.

EDUC-8360. Introduction to Educational Policy Analysis
This course focuses on a critical and disciplined examination of education policy issues drawing on a variety of
theoretical orientations such as positivist, pluralist, post-positivist, poststructuralist and others. These
perspectives provide different lenses to view current and past education reform and restructuring policies in
Ontario and other jurisdictions in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Finland, U.S.A, and the U.K. It reviews
current theoretical approaches to the nature, development, and implementation of educational policy at all
levels. The course critiques policy-makers’ approaches to reform, and restructuring, and the potential short-
and long-term impacts of these changes on the philosophy, content and practices in the public education
arena. By thinking about what sort of people and voices inhabit the texts of policy, the course enables
participants to think about how we engage with the social and collective identities of our research subjects in
an attempt to capture the complex interplay of identities and interests, and coalitions, conflicts and uneasy
‘settlements’ within the processes and enactments of policy.

EDUC-8370. Language Arts in the Elementary School
This course will examine issues in language arts instruction in the light of current language theories. The focus is
on current research and its practical application, with special emphasis on methods of instruction, teacher
strategies, student activities and evaluation practices.

EDUC-8380. The Arts and Education
This course explores how the arts influence the construction of meaning in society, both within and beyond the
classroom. Representation, through images, music, and text, traditionally serve to preserve cultural memory,
but can also reflect changing social mores, challenge established ideas, and trigger new ways of thinking.
Readings will include current research in the arts and education, and class activities will include the production
and interpretation of images and artefacts.

EDUC-8400. Language, Culture, and Society
The New London Group (1996, 2000), an international group of literacy experts, coined the term
“multiliteracies.” In their manifesto, they suggested that literacy needs to focus on ensuring that people of
diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds be able to integrate in all societies without losing what is unique to
their identities, and for accents and dialects to be recognized as a part of the English language (that there is no
one true standard English). It is a matter of equity that we find genuine ways to embrace diversity. The other
thrust of the New London Group's theory is that multiliteracies provide a better way to define literacy because
it acknowledges the role that technologies, multimodalities, semiotics, and media play in literacy and how
meaning is constructed and communicated. A multiliteracies theoretical framework has implications for
systemic as well as individual changes in both schools and broader societies. This course will trace some of the
historical roots of multiliteracies in critical theory as well as analyze how multiliteracies are developing in
practical and theoretical terms in the current world.

EDUC-8410. The Social Science Curriculum
An examination of trends and development of social science curricula. Curriculum theory will be applied to one
or more of the social sciences within the context of provincial guidelines and the academic and professional
qualifications of the students.

EDUC-8420. Language System Analysis


                                                                                                                 115

This course is a broad introduction to the analytic study of human languages. It surveys language systems such
as: phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. It explains how those systems interact with
each other synchronically in discourse and diachronically in creating language families. Students have an
opportunity to examine the universal features of all languages and their relationship to linguistic variety. Topics
in historical linguistics, sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, and neurolinguistics are explored. Various writing
systems used in world languages are also discussed.

EDUC-8430. Special Education and Language Acquisition
The relationship between language acquisition, perceived learning dis/abilities, and special education support
has been the subject of ongoing debate. Key topics linked to this debate include: language impairment, needs
assessment, access to support, method of support, program design, and disproportional representation. These
matters have significant implications for language learners, educators, and program developers alike. Those
involved in teaching-learning an additional language, whatever that language might be, face a number of
important questions, including: What is language impairment? How should the needs of language learners be
assessed? Who should access support? What should that support look like? What should inclusion look like in a
language learning setting? Why have language learners been disproportionally represented in some special
education programs? As these questions indicate, language learning is complicated, and is intertwined with a
number of social justice issues. In this course, students will critically examine a range of current research, and
draw conclusions about the discourse on the relationship between language acquisition, perceived learning
dis/abilities, and special education support.

EDUC-8450. Teaching for Sustainability: An Introduction to Environmental Education
This course will engage students in an analysis and investigation of the philosophical and pedagogical
underpinnings of EE, and the pragmatic relevance of learning for sustainability. To this end students will get an
opportunity to critically discuss, analyze, and evaluate a variety of perspectives around the environmental
debate and assist them in articulating, clarifying, and/or refining their own assumptions and position about the
environment and implications for sustainability. Fundamental questions to be answered include, what is the
rationale for teaching and learning for sustainability and what are the core principles and competencies that
should drive this pursuit? Secondly, what pedagogical constructs are useful in effective teaching and learning
for sustainability? Students will engage in investigations of real world environmental issues, and problem-
solving, and experiential learning through field-trips.

EDUC-8470. Learning in Science
This course will consider current research and theory in the promotion of science as a process and product.

and problem-solving acquired through the other courses. It will normally be taken following completion of the
other coursework. (Prerequisites: EDUC-8001).

EDUC-8940. Thesis Proposal
Candidates pursuing a Master’s thesis, under the guidance of the thesis supervisor, internal thesis reader, and
other faculty where appropriate, will engage in the preparation and defence of a Masters thesis proposal.
(Before registering for the Thesis Proposal (EDUC-8940), students must have completed all required courses in
their program. The Thesis Proposal may be completed concurrently with one elective in the final semester of
coursework.) Thesis stream students must enrol in EDUC-8940 (Thesis Proposal) and do so for each subsequent
term until the thesis proposal has successfully been defended.

EDUC-8960. Major Paper
Conducted under the guidance of at least two members of the Faculty, a major paper may analyze and evaluate
a substantial body of scholarly literature or describe or interpret a research project undertaken by the student.
The major paper is subject to an oral examination (see section titled, The Master's Degree - Thesis or Major
Paper, and the section titled Education - The Master of Education Degree - Program Requirements.)

EDUC-8970. Thesis
Students may enrol concurrently in the Thesis Proposal (EDUC-8940) and the Thesis (EDUC-8970) if all course
work is complete. If students register for the Thesis Proposal (EDUC-8940) and the Thesis (EDUC-8970)
concurrently, then only upon completion of the thesis proposal may thesis stream students begin their Thesis.
They must enrol in EDUC-8970 (Thesis) for each subsequent term until the successful completion and
deposition of the thesis.

EDUC-9020. Doctoral Seminar I
In Core Seminar 1, the history and philosophical foundations of education are examined through the three
fields of study. As well, students are introduced to qualitative methods of research in education, encompassing
interview, phenomenological, ethnographic, constructivist, and case study approaches to data collection,
analysis, and interpretation.

EDUC-9040. Doctoral Seminar 2
In Core Seminar 2 students examine research, theories, and issues in the fields of study via a specific theme
which is identified annually. For example, the theme might be bullying, or caring education, or gender issues. As
well, students are introduced to quantitative methods of research in education, encompassing true
experiments, quasi experiments, and correlational studies.

EDUC-9210. Educational Leadership and Policy Studies
This course introduces students to the origins and intellectual traditions of theories that influence how we
organize education. Students develop an understanding of sociological paradigms that have influenced
educational systems over time, and develop perspectives that enable them to think critically and creatively
about contemporary and future issues in educational leadership, policy, and organizations.

EDUC-9310. Socio/Cultural/Political Contexts of Education
This course centres around a critical examination of cultural, historical, and theoretical perspectives in
education. Bodies of knowledge related to understanding the complexities of sociocultural influences in
education are the main focus. Power relations at play and how they are negotiated in everyday practice are
considered. Using the sociocultural framework developed in the course, students also investigate their specific
areas of interest (for example, curriculum theory and practice).

EDUC-9410. Cognition and Learning


                                                                                                               119

This course provides an analysis of epistemological theories through a critical examination of foundational and
current research and a reflection on historical and philosophical orientations as they relate to contemporary
issues in cognition and learning.

EDUC-9510. The Specialized Elective
The content for this course must relate to the student’s dissertation topic and field of study. The course may be
selected from the graduate studies calendar of courses from one of the participating universities, or it may be
taken as a directed study. A directed study takes place under the supervision of a faculty member with
appropriate expertise. Usually, the student completes a sustained program of study relating to a topic of
current theoretical and/or empirical interest leading to the production of a substantial research paper. Directed
studies are intended for students with special interests which cannot be satisfied by calendar courses.

EDUC-9690. Research Proposal Colloquium
In this course students examine theory and research in relation to their intended dissertation topic. Students
develop a topic idea in the form of a dissertation proposal, defining a research question and a theoretical base
for intended study. Students examine research questions in relation to varied methodologies, so that a diverse
examination of research frameworks takes place through WebCT based discourse.

FACULTY OF ENGINEERING
PROGRAMS
Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)
PhD program requirements are common for the following Engineering programs: Civil Engineering, Electrical
Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Engineering Materials, Mechanical Engineering. The areas of
specialization are listed by Department.

Admission Requirements

An applicant for admission to a course of graduate studies leading to the Doctor of Philosophy degree in
Engineering must normally be a graduate of a recognized university with a Master's degree in Engineering or
Applied Science. Applicants with degrees in related fields will be considered but will normally require
strengthening of their background in engineering. At the discretion of the Program Graduate Committee,
Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) may be required.

All applicants whose native language is not English are required to satisfy the English proficiency requirement
as described in the application procedures listed in this calendar.

Possession of the minimum requirements does not automatically ensure acceptance to the degree program.

Candidacy: Admission to graduate study does not imply admission to candidacy for a degree. The candidacy of
a student normally will be determined within the second year after initial registration in the doctoral program.

Candidacy will be granted to students who meet all of the following requirements:
(a) satisfactory completion of the comprehensive examination;
(b)demonstration to the doctoral committee of ability to conduct independent research;
(c)acceptance by the doctoral committee of the research proposal.

The doctoral committee will assess the student's competence to continue research on the basis of (a), (b) and
(c), and inform the Chair of the Program Graduate Committee.

Program Requirements

The specific minimum program requirements for the PhD. include the successful completion of:

1) Course Requirements: Satisfactory completion of at least four courses, comprising a minimum of eight term
hours, beyond the courses required for the Master's degree.

2) A comprehensive examination.

3) Satisfactory progress in research within each review period. The doctoral committee will establish by
periodic review, which will include at least one formal seminar a year, that adequate progress in research has
been accomplished by the candidate. The doctoral committee will also grant permission to write the
dissertation when it decides the candidate has achieved sufficient competence in carrying out research, and
when the candidate has done substantial research.

                                                                                                                 121
Spring 2024 Academic Calendar
4) A dissertation on the research. Each candidate will be required to make an oral presentation of the
dissertation research and will be examined orally on the subject of the dissertation and related fields.

Residence and Time Limits: Every student will undertake a full program of study for a minimum of three years
beyond the Baccalaureate of Engineering or its equivalent. Credit for one of these years may be given for the
time spent in proceeding to a Master's degree. Credit for one of these years may also be given for work done at
another institution. However, in no case shall the student spend fewer than two of the three required years of
residence in full-time attendance at the University of Windsor.

A student admitted to a PhD. program requiring the student's attendance for a minimum of three years must
complete all requirements within seven years. Students admitted to a program requiring a minimum of two
years' residence must complete all requirements within six years.

Committees: Research undertaken as part of a doctoral program is normally directed and supervised by a
doctoral committee. Whereas the student's advisor provides day-to-day guidance and direction, the committee
is ultimately responsible for the overall supervision to ensure that adequate progress is being maintained. The
doctoral committee will consist of at least four members, with the student's advisor as chairperson. The advisor
must be a member of graduate faculty. At least one member shall be from a program area within the University
of Windsor other than the one in which the student is majoring.

The student's advisor will propose the names of members for the doctoral committee, and these will be subject
to the approval of the Program Graduate Committee and the Executive Committee of the Faculty of Graduate
Studies. Within one month after initial registration, each student will be assigned to a doctoral committee.

The final appraisal of the dissertation and the conduct of the final oral examination of the dissertation will be
carried out by an examining committee. The examining committee will consist of the doctoral committee, the
Dean of Graduate Studies or designate as chairperson (non-voting), and an external examiner.

Examinations: At the discretion of the doctoral committee a qualifying examination may be required. A
qualifying examination is one in which the student is asked to demonstrate a reasonable mastery of the
fundamentals in the major subject; it is designed to test the student's preparation for advanced graduate work.
If such an examination is required, it must be administered and passed before the student registers for the
second year of PhD. work.

In addition to the usual examinations on course work, all students must meet the following requirements:

1) Review of Progress on Research: Within the first year, the student will present in the form of a seminar an
outline of his or her proposed thesis research. This will be presented to the doctoral committee who must
approve, with or without modifications, or reject the proposal. Thereafter, at least once a year the student will
report his or her progress in the form of a seminar.

2) Comprehensive Examination: Students who have previously obtained a Master's degree must attempt this
examination within twelve months of registering for the PhD. program. Other students must take it within
twenty-four months of registration for the PhD. program. This set of examinations requires the students to
demonstrate an adequate background in the general discipline of engineering, and an advanced knowledge in
their fields of specialization.

The comprehensive examination will be conducted by a program comprehensive committee in one or two
sections at the discretion of the Program Graduate Committee:


                                                                                                                122
Spring 2024 Academic Calendar
(a) a scheduled, supervised written portion, of at least three hours' duration, designed to test the student's
general knowledge on core subjects in the field of study, with questions set and answers evaluated by the
program comprehensive committee;
(b)an oral examination to be evaluated by the program comprehensive committee. The objective of this part of
the examination is to test the student's ability to integrate general knowledge from different areas of the field
of study in order to solve problems the student has not previously encountered.

The student's overall success in the comprehensive examination will be determined by the program
comprehensive committee. If the student is unsuccessful, the committee may require:

(a) that the student repeat all or part of the comprehensive examination at a specified time,
(b)that the student take and pass remedial coursework before repeating all or part of the examination, or
(c)after consultation with and approval by the doctoral committee, that the student withdraw from the
program.

3) Final Examination: The passing of the final oral examination of the dissertation requires both an adequate
dissertation and a satisfactory defence of the dissertation. This examination will be conducted by the examining
committee. Following the acceptance and provisional approval of the dissertation by the doctoral committee,
and a satisfactory preliminary report from the external examiner, a date for the oral examination can be set.
Except under very unusual circumstances, the external examiner must be present at the oral examination. If the
examining committee cannot arrive at a unanimous decision to award a passing grade, the majority decision
will be accepted provided that there is no more than one dissenting vote. However, if the dissenting vote is that
of the external examiner, a new external examiner may be appointed and another oral examination will be
required. If the new examiner also gives a dissenting vote, the dissertation will not be accepted.

Research in Outside Institutions

Research for the PhD or MASc degree, in part or in whole, may be carried out in an outside institution (e.g.,
industrial, governmental, or academic university). A student who does research at an outside institution must
fulfil the same requirements as a student doing on-campus research. The only exception is that the time spent
doing the off-campus research relevant to the thesis or dissertation will be credited toward the residence
requirement. In addition to the general requirements, a student applying for permission to do research at an
outside institution must provide:

1. A detailed statement of the research proposal, including arrangements for supervision, and of the
circumstances under which the research is to be carried out.
2. Evidence that the institution has adequate facilities for the research; and that the applicant will be able to
pursue independent research.
3. A proposed time schedule.
4. A letter of support from a responsible person in the outside institution giving approval of the proposal and
accepting these regulations.




                                                                                                                    123

the dissertation and related fields.

Residence and Time Limits: Every student will undertake a full Program of study for a minimum of three years
beyond the Baccalaureate of Engineering or its equivalent. Credit for one of these years may be given for the
time spent in proceeding to a Master's degree. Credit for one of these years may also be given for work done at
another institution. A student admitted to a PhD. Program requiring the student's attendance for a minimum of
three years must complete all requirements within seven years. Students requiring a minimum of two years'
residence must complete all requirements within six years.

                                                                                                                125
Spring 2024 Academic Calendar
Committees: Research undertaken as part of a doctoral Program is directed and supervised by a doctoral
committee, which is assigned within the first term of registration. Whereas the student's advisor provides day
to day guidance and direction, this committee is ultimately responsible for the overall supervision to ensure
that adequate progress is being maintained.

The doctoral committee will be composed of at least 4 faculty members including:
1) the student's advisor,
2) two other faculty members from within the program, and
3) one internal external faculty member outside the student's department and within the University of
Windsor.

The student's advisor will recommend the members of the doctoral committee, whose appointment must be
approved by the Executive Committee of Graduate Studies and Research.

Examinations:

Qualifying Examination: At the discretion of the doctoral committee, a qualifying examination may be
required. A qualifying examination is one in which the student is asked to demonstrate a reasonable mastery of
the fundamentals in the major subject; it is designed to test the student's preparation for advanced graduate
work. If such an examination is required, it must be administered and passed before the student registers for
the second year of PhD. work.

The Proposal: Normally within the first 2 years, the student will present in the form of a seminar an outline of
their proposed thesis research. This will be presented to the doctoral committee who must approve, with or
without modifications, or reject the proposal. Thereafter, at least once a year the student will report their
progress in the form of a seminar.

Comprehensive Examination: Students who have previously obtained a Master's degree must attempt this
examination very early between twelve to eighteen months of registering for the PhD. Program. Other students
must take it within twenty-four months of registration for the PhD. Program. A comprehensive examination
committee will conduct the comprehensive examination. The committee will consist of the chair, three
members of the supervisory committee, including the supervisor, and an additional member who has a
scholarly interest in the student's general area of specialization.

This set of examinations requires the students to demonstrate an adequate background in the general
discipline of applied science, and an advanced knowledge in their fields of specialization and research.

The comprehensive examinations will be conducted in two parts:
a) In the first part, a scheduled supervised written portion, of three hours duration, designed to test the
student's general knowledge on core subjects in the field of study as approved by the examination committee,
with questions set and answers evaluated by the examination committee.
b) An oral examination to be evaluated by the examination committee. The objective of this part of
examination is to evaluate the student's ability to integrate general knowledge from different areas into their
research plan. The candidate will be required to submit a report, up to 25 pages in length, on the proposed
research program. The report must include: (i) a critical survey of the directly related literature in the field, and
(ii) an outline of the proposed research program, including its justification, the approach to be taken, specific
analytical or experimental methods, perceived or anticipated problems, and a proposed timetable to
accomplish the task. Five copies of the report must be in the hands of the examining committee at least seven
days prior to the date of the oral examination. The oral examination will be conducted in two sessions. In the
first part, the candidate will be required to present their report in a summary fashion to the committee

                                                                                                                   126
Spring 2024 Academic Calendar
followed by questions directly related to the proposal and the candidate's specific area of research. The second
part of the oral examination will emphasize the candidate's comprehension as well as breadth and depth of
knowledge of their discipline area. The duration of the two parts of the oral examination is expected to be
about one and half hours each, separated by a recess of half an hour.

It is the responsibility of the examining committee chair to call a meeting of the committee at least seven days
prior to oral examination to: (i) examine the candidate's records and the type of background necessary to carry
on their research successfully, and (ii) assign the preparation of the written questions for the first part, to
members of the committee, other than the supervisor. The supervisor will not participate in the preparation of
the written questions but is expected to participate in the oral examination.

The Examination Committee will determine the student's overall performance and success in the
comprehensive examination. If the student is unsuccessful, the committee may require:
i. That the student repeats all or part of the comprehensive examination at a specified time;
ii. That the student takes and pass remedial course work before repeating all or part of the examination; or
iii. After consultation with, and approval by, the doctoral committee, that the student withdraws from the
program.

Final Examination. The final appraisal of the dissertation and the conduct of the final oral examination of the
dissertation will be carried out by an examining committee. The examining committee will consist of the
doctoral committee, the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research (or designate) as chairperson (non-voting) and
an external examiner. The final examination normally follows a public seminar by the candidate, open to the
public. The passing of the final oral examination of the dissertation requires both an adequate dissertation and
a satisfactory defence of the dissertation. The examining committee will conduct this examination, in
accordance with the Faculty of Graduate Studies procedures.

This set of examinations requires the students to demonstrate an adequate background in the general
discipline of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems, and an advanced knowledge in their fields.

Master of Applied Science (MASc)
MASc program requirements are common for the following Engineering programs: Civil Engineering, Electrical
Engineering, Engineering Materials, Environmental Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. Industrial
Engineering has slight variation. The areas of specialization are listed by Department.

Admission Requirements

A candidate for the degree of Master of Applied Science shall hold the degree of Bachelor of Applied Science
from this University or an equivalent degree in Engineering or Applied Science. In addition, the applicant must
have at least second-class standing or its equivalent in the final year and be recommended by the Program
Graduate Committee in which the candidate plans to undertake studies.

Applicants with degrees in related fields will be considered but will normally require strengthening of their
background in Engineering. At the discretion of the Program, the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) may be
required.

All applicants whose native language is not English are required to satisfy the English proficiency requirement.

Possession of the minimum requirements does not automatically ensure acceptance.



                                                                                                                127
Spring 2024 Academic Calendar
Degree Requirements
The specific minimum program requirements for the MASc include the successful completion of:

1. Course Requirements: Satisfactory completion of courses comprising between twelve and twenty-four term
hours, depending on the term hour equivalence assigned to the mandatory thesis or major paper. A thesis may
be equivalent to as many as eighteen term hours, and a major paper to as many as six term hours of the total
minimum requirement of thirty term hours.

2. Either a thesis or a major paper as specified below:

(a) Thesis: A thesis incorporating the results of an original investigation is required of all candidates except
those students who are doing non-thesis research toward a major paper. Before writing the thesis the student
must meet with the Master's committee to obtain permission to write the thesis. The Master's committee will
grant this permission when the student has shown sufficient competence and has accomplished substantial
research. After completion of the thesis, each candidate will be required to make a satisfactory oral
presentation and defence of the thesis as described below.

(b) Major Paper: For those candidates doing non-thesis research, a major paper is required. The topic of the
major paper is normally research based on the existing literature in the field of study. The candidate will be
required to make an acceptable oral presentation to the Master's committee based on the major paper (see
below).

3. Mechanical Engineering students in the MASc program must take MECH-8295 (MASc Graduate Seminar) and
Mechanical Engineering students in the PhD program must take MECH 9295 (PhD Graduate Seminar).

Note: Part-time students who are not able to take the MASc Graduate Seminar course have to take an
additional 3-credit graduate course approved by his/her degree supervisor(s), if necessary, to fulfill the overall
credit requirement for the degree; or Part-time students who are not able to take the PhD Graduate Seminar
course have to take an additional 3-credit graduate course approved by his/her degree supervisor(s), if
necessary, to fulfill the overall credit requirement for the degree."

4. Industrial Engineering students must additionally take INDE-8595 (Graduate Seminar). They are expected to
register in it every semester offered. Normally in the final year of their degree, they are to give a seminar
presentation and will receive a Pass/Fail grade. For the MASc. thesis or Major Paper in Industrial Engineering
the final grade is “Satisfactory” or “Unsatisfactory”.

Residence and Time Limits
The minimum period of study for a Master's candidate is twelve months. The maximum duration of full-time
study as a Master's candidate is three years. Part-time Master's candidates will undertake the equivalent of a
minimum of one year of full-time study. For a part-time Master's candidate the maximum time limit generally
will not exceed five calendar years. Master's candidates who expect to require an extension of these time limits
must petition the Dean of Graduate Studies, giving reasons for the request and plans for completion of the
work. The Chair of the Program Graduate Committee will then make a recommendation to the Dean of
Graduate Studies.

Committees
Research undertaken as part of a Master's program is normally directed and supervised by a Master's
committee. Whereas the student's advisor provides day-to-day guidance and direction, the committee is
ultimately responsible for the overall supervision to ensure that adequate progress is maintained. The Master's
committee will consist of at least three members with the student's advisor as chairperson. The advisor must
be a member of graduate faculty.

                                                                                                                 128
Spring 2024 Academic Calendar
At least one member shall be from a Program within the University of Windsor other than the one in which the
student is majoring. The student's advisor will propose the names of the Master's committee and these will be
subject to the approval of the Program Graduate Committee and the Executive Committee of the Faculty of
Graduate Studies. Within one month after registration, each student will be assigned to a Master's committee.

The final appraisal of the thesis and the conduct of the final oral examination of the dissertation will be carried
out by the examining committee. The examining committee will consist of the Master's committee and the
Chair of the Program Graduate Committee or designate of the Dean of Graduate Studies as chairperson (non-
voting).

Examinations: At the discretion of the Program Graduate Committee a qualifying examination may be required.
A qualifying examination is one in which the student is asked to demonstrate a reasonable mastery of the
fundamentals in the major subject; it is designed to test the student's preparation for advanced graduate work.
If such an examination is required, it must be administered and passed before the student registers for the final
candidate year of Master's work.

In addition to the usual examination on course work, all students must meet the following requirements:

1) Review of Progress on Research or Major Paper: Within the first year a full-time student will present in the
form of a seminar an outline of his or her proposed thesis research or outline the content of his or her major
paper. This will be presented to the Master's committee, who must approve, with or without modifications, or
reject the proposal. Thereafter, at least once a year, the student will report his or her progress in the form of a
seminar.

2) Final Examinations: The passing of the final oral examination on the thesis (or the major paper) requires
both an adequate thesis (or major paper) and a satisfactory defence. The examination will be conducted by the
examining committee and the thesis defence will be chaired by the Chair of the Program Graduate Committee
or appointed designate. If the examining committee cannot arrive at a unanimous decision to award a passing
grade, a majority decision will be accepted provided there is no more than one dissenting vote. If there is more
than one dissenting vote, the student may be required to carry out additional work if the thesis is judged to be
adequate in all other respects, or the student may be required to withdraw.

Grading: The grading system is outlined in "Faculty Regulations".

The Faculty of Engineering requires that students maintain at least a 70% average at all times.

Courses in which a grade of 70% or higher is received will be accepted for graduate credit. In addition, upon the
positive recommendation of the Chair of the Program Graduate Committee and advisor concerned, credit may
be granted by the Faculty of Graduate Studies for not more than two term courses in which a grade between
65-69% has been obtained.

If a student fails to obtain credit in a course, the course may be repeated only once, at the discretion of the
Chair of the Program Graduate Committee concerned and the Dean of Graduate Studies. No student may
repeat, or replace with another course, more than two term courses in which credit was not obtained.

All research work for which a letter grade is assigned must be graded 70% or better to receive credit.

Make-up courses will not count for graduate credit. Make-up courses are those courses required to
compensate for deficiencies in the student's academic background.


                                                                                                                  129
Spring 2024 Academic Calendar
In exceptional cases, at the discretion of the Chair of the Program Graduate Committee and the advisor, a
graduate student may take one undergraduate course for credit.

Integrated BASc/MASc
The Faculty of Engineering offers a Bachelor's/Master's Integrated Engineering Degree program which allows
students with outstanding academic ability to achieve both a BASc and MASc degree in a time period as short
as five years. This program treats the educational process through the BASc to the MASc degree as a single
coherent integrated whole, while ensuring that the requirements for both degrees are fully satisfied. This
structured program represents a complementary alternative to the existing separate undergraduate and
graduate degree programs.

Application to the integrated BASc/MASc can be made early in the Winter semester of the student's third year
of undergraduate B.A.Sc. study. Normally, only applicants who have a cumulative average of at least 77%, and a
semester average of 77% in the Fall semester of their third year of undergraduate BASc. study may be granted
admission to the integrated program which confers conditional admission status to the MASc. program.

Contact the appropriate Engineering Department for more information.

Research in Outside Institutions
Research for the PhD or MASc degree, in part or in whole, may be carried out in an outside institution (e.g.,
industrial, governmental, or academic university). A student who does research at an outside institution must
fulfil the same requirements as a student doing on-campus research. The only exception is that the time spent
doing the off-campus research relevant to the thesis or dissertation will be credited toward the residence
requirement. In addition to the general requirements, a student applying for permission to do research at an
outside institution must provide:

1) A detailed statement of the research proposal, including arrangements for supervision, and of the
circumstances under which the research is to be carried out;
2) Evidence that the institution has adequate facilities for the research; and that the applicant will be able to
pursue independent research;
3) A proposed time schedule;
4) A letter of support from a responsible person in the outside institution giving approval of the proposal and
accepting these regulations.

Master of Engineering (MEng)
Program requirements are common for: Civil Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Engineering
Materials, Environmental Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Mechanical Engineering,

The Master of Engineering (MEng) degree offered at the University of Windsor is a course work professional
program open to students who satisfy the admission requirements. The MEng Program takes three to five
semesters to complete but is structured in such a way that it may be completed in one year by a full-time
student. The minimum period of full-time registration for the MEng degree is three semesters and the
maximum allowable time is five semesters. For part-time students, the minimum period of registration for the
MEng degree is eight semesters and the maximum allowable time is fifteen consecutive semesters. Practical
work-experience placements are available for full-time students only, but cannot be guaranteed.

2.3 Co-op/Internship – Work Term Option

MECH-8071. The work term is offered on a pass/fail basis. It provides the opportunity for students to enhance
academic learning with valuable industrial experience, and to develop transferable skills in an applied setting.
Students must apply for admission to the Co-op/internship option in their first study term (Prerequisite:
Departmental permission). Students can complete a four (4) month work term.

All Co-op/Internship positions must be full-time, paid, related to the degree program, and approved by the
University. The process of securing a Co-op/Internship position is competitive. Co-op/Internship students will
apply for work opportunities as advertised by the Centre for Career Education using an Internet-based software
program and employers will make interview and hiring decisions. Students are also encouraged to seek Co-
op/Internship employment outside of the advertised postings by completing a guided job search process
facilitated by the Centre for Career Education. All Co-op/Internship students must, in the first and second
semester of their program, register and pass three (3) graduate courses for their program.

Withdrawal from the Co-op/Internship program will be granted only under exceptional circumstances. For
example, it must be determined that the student has no outstanding commitments to employers. Students who
wish to withdraw must meet with a Co-op Coordinator and complete a withdrawal form. However, the only
time a student may withdraw from a graduate Co-op/Internship program without further Co-op/Internship fee
payment implications is by the 1st Friday of classes after their first Co-op/Internship work term. Students who
withdraw from Co-operative Education at any other time will be liable for paying the Co-op/Internship fee for
the term in which they are dropping and one additional term.

In the interest of building solid partnerships with employers, students who have accepted a co-op employment
offer (either by ranking a position in round 1 of the job competition or by accepting a position in later rounds
(either verbally or in writing) must honour that commitment. Therefore, once students have accepted an offer
of employment for a work term, they will be considered registered in the appropriate work term course and
must remain in the Co-op/Internship program until they have completed their work term requirements. Failure

                                                                                                                132
Spring 2024 Academic Calendar
to honour these commitments and/or to complete all work term requirements will lead to being required to
withdraw from the Co-op/Internship program and will result in a failing grade on his/her transcript for that
work term.

Master of Engineering co-op/internship students will be registered in a work term course for the four-month
term of their placement. This course will be evaluated on a pass-fail basis. In order to receive a passing grade,
students must:

Submit learning objectives at the beginning of the -month work term
Receive a satisfactory mid work term assessment from supervisor
Submit and receive a passing grade on a work term report (guidelines prepared by faculty and report evaluated
by faculty)

Complete and receive a satisfactory post-work term presentation (evaluated by Co-op Coordinator and Faculty)
Receive a satisfactory final work term performance evaluation by employer

3. Schemes of Study
The Master of Engineering may be taken by full-time students or those who wish to study on a part-time basis
while remaining in full-time employment. All applicants for the MEng program are expected to be entirely self-
funded and no financial assistance will be provided by the Faculty of Engineering or the University of Windsor.

PROGRAMS
Master of Laws (LLC)
Windsor Law's Master’s program (LLM) will stress rigorous scholarship, centred on our institutional themes of
Access to Justice and Transnational Law. A key feature of the Windsor LLM will be that our students, while
enrolled, will make concrete contributions to legal scholarship. Moreover, students in our unique and
innovative LLM with Certificate in University Teaching and Learning stream will be offered the chance to
complete the University of Windsor’s internationally recognized University Teaching Certificate program as part
of their course of study, as well as the opportunity to engage in law teaching. In addition to students
contemplating an academic career, the program will be suitable for legal practitioners interested in developing
expertise in a specialized area of law. Wherever possible, students will be integrated into our Law Faculty’s
existing Centres, and interdisciplinary and multi-disciplinary collaborations will be promoted.

The experiential learning component of the program consists of the law teaching practicum that students in the
LLM with Certificate in University Teaching and Learning stream will complete. The law teaching practicum will,
in most cases, extend for a maximum of four weeks (or twelve hours) of teaching. The practicum may be
completed in a variety of ways including as part of a team of professors/instructors teaching a course, as a
series of guest lectures in a faculty member’s course and, for students who show exceptional promise or who
have exceptional background in teaching, the teaching of a one-semester course.

Admission Requirements
Students who are accepted to the program will be academically inclined, motivated, and committed to
continuous learning. Outside of exceptional circumstances, students applying to the LL.M program will be
required to have an undergraduate law degree. In rare cases, a student may be admitted without a law degree.
For students without law degrees to gain entry, they must have outstanding grades or experience and superior
ability to complete the LL.M program. Admission to the program will be based on four categories which
evaluate the student’s: a) aptitudes, b) academic achievements, c) research proposal and, d) additional
requirements such as reference letters and language proficiency. Details of these four broad categories are as
follows:

Aptitudes
Generally, successful students admitted to our LL.M program will demonstrate the following aptitudes in terms
of their ability to apply themselves, their knowledge, and their reasoning and communication skills.
Specifically, the student accepted into the program will have shown evidence of:

Application: exceptional academic motivation; capacity for sustained and intense work; developed ability to
organize time and set own agenda for study; academic curiosity for investigation and learning.

Knowledge: a broad, deep, advanced, and integrated understanding of the main branches of law and / or a
related discipline.

Reasoning ability: outstanding analytical abilities, including the ability to draw and maintain fine distinctions,
the ability to separate the relevant from the irrelevant, and the ability to develop and sustain complex
arguments; capacities for accurate observation and insightful criticism, including willingness and ability to


                                                                                                                     173
Spring 2024 Academic Calendar
engage with disciplines other than law and to bring their insights to bear on legal problems; originality and
creativity of thought, open-mindedness, and capacity for lateral thinking; excellent powers of synthesis.

Communication: willingness and ability to express highly complex ideas clearly and effectively; ability to
conduct a mature debate leaving room for the contributions of others; aspiration to professional standards of
style and organization in legal and scholarly writing.

Academic Achievements
First and foremost, applicants will be able to demonstrate their exceptional abilities through their academic
achievements. Generally, this will mean high academic standing – normally at least a 70% average in an
undergraduate law program (although this alone will not necessarily guarantee admission), and evidence of
interest in academic pursuits (for example, pursuing independent/supervised research studies, publications,
editing of academic work, etc.). For applicants applying from the workforce, noteworthy achievements may
also be taken into account for what they reveal about the applicant’s ability to succeed academically within a
Master’s program in Law. All applicants will also be required to submit their undergraduate transcripts.

Research Proposal
A significant element of each student’s application package will be the statement of proposed research. The
research proposal should provide evidence of the candidate's ability and potential to engage with the relevant
scholarly literature, doctrinal and/or empirical material and to formulate pertinent research questions. An
academic writing sample will also be required.

Additional Requirements
Applicants will be asked to submit at least two letters of reference that show support for their scholarly
endeavour. Admission will be contingent upon availability of a suitable supervisor and suitable reference
materials for the applicant to pursue their research project.

Finally, all students must meet an English language proficiency standard of 250 (600) IBT-100 minimum on the
TOEFL or 7.0 IELTS

Spring 2024 Academic Calendar
Additional requirements:
Presentation of research at scholarly conferences or other academic venues outside of Windsor Law’s graduate
program.

In order to obtain wider academic feedback, students will be required to present their research as an academic
talk. During the write-up phase of their thesis, students will be a) required to present their work in progress in
an open faculty/graduate student seminar (outside of the graduate seminar) and b) encouraged to present
their work at subject-relevant conferences which foster graduate student networking, such as the Canadian
Law and Society Association annual conference.

Subject-relevant conferences should be academic in nature for example, a graduate students’ conference,
faculty seminars, or conferences/workshops set up by learned associations such as the Canadian Law and
Society Association. Students may also organize their own talks. In this connection, the Graduate Studies
Committee has begun to make connections with other universities and research institutes which may be
interested in hosting presentations by our graduate students.

Standing Required for Continuation in the Experiential Learning Option of the Program
Students will need to pass the teaching practicum and otherwise meet the normal regulations for continuation
in the program as set by the University’s regulations.


LAW COURSES
MASTER OF LAW COURSES

LAWM-8100. Research Methods
Through this required course, and in view of writing the LLM thesis, students will focus on developing research
questions, elaborating appropriate methodological approaches for their graduate research (i.e. the Master’s
thesis), preparing a research agenda, creating a literature review, and on creating a written report of their
research findings. The central part of the course will place emphasis on learning contemporary methodological
approaches to legal scholarship. Although the research methods discussed may vary from year to year,
doctrinal (case-based), qualitative, and historical research methods will be examined. Students will also develop
ethical and interdisciplinary approaches to academic legal research and advanced library research skills. (6
credits, 2-term course.) (Open only to LLM students.)

LAWM-8200. Legal Theory
Drawing from continental and analytic writings manifesting social contextual, historical, anthropological, and
philosophical perspectives, this course will, in particular, examine issues surrounding the relation of legal orders
to outsiders, the social-cultural context of the nature of a law, the nature of legal obligation and the boundary
of law as a discourse.

LAWM-8300. Graduate Seminar
An adjunct to the LL.M Research Methods course, the Graduate Seminar will provide a forum in which students
can discuss their ongoing research and present portions of their work for feedback from the course director
and their peers. The seminar will convene for the equivalent of 1hour/week, every other week, over the course
of the fall and winter semesters (12 hours total).

LAWM-8400. Law Teaching in the Diverse Classroom
This course will examine theory and techniques for engaging with controversial topics in the law school class
setting. Through this course, students will focus on learning, and evaluating critically, different approaches to
teaching in classroom settings that require cultural competence and other diversity competencies. This course
                                                                                                                 175
Spring 2024 Academic Calendar
will focus on understanding how student learning is influenced by individual experiences, gender, language,
culture, family and community. Students will also work on developing their own approaches to teaching in such
settings. This course serves to complement the LL.M student’s learning experience in the University Teaching
Certificate Program (or equivalent) by offering exposure to issues related specifically to law teaching.
(Prerequisite for students in the teaching stream: completion of UTC lesson plan exercise in the UTC course
“Learning Centred Teaching in Higher Education”) (1.5 credit)

LAWM-8970. Thesis
The central component of the program's requirements is the completion of original publishable research. A
major written piece of original research, the thesis may be submitted as one single document or as a set of
publishable articles totalling approximately 100-125 pages in length.

MASTER OF SOCIAL WORK/JURIS DOCTOR COURSES

LAWG-5930. Law and Social Work: Advanced Practice Research Methods and Policy Analysis
This course prepares students to use the practitioner-researcher model in the analysis of social policy, as it
relates to law, in Canada. This model includes problem formation, qualitative and quantitative research design,
data analysis and interpretation, and the dissemination of findings. Students will learn to apply specific analytic
frameworks and theories, drawn from law and social work, to issues of Canadian social policy. In addition,
students will learn essential elements of program evaluation including needs assessment, program logic
models, implementation and process evaluations, and impact evaluations. Particular attention will be given to
the implications of social policy for vulnerable and oppressed populations. Credit Weight 4.0. (Cross-listed with
Social Work SWRK-8625).

LAWG-5931. Advanced Seminar in the Theory and Practice of Social Work and the Law
This seminar focuses on the intersection of law and social work in theory and practice. It will prepare students
to think critically about the interrelationship between law and social work, both as disciplines and professions,
and to identify and analyze theoretical and substantive areas of compatibility and tension. The challenges of
interdisciplinary practice will be considered, with a particular emphasis on ethical norms and the advancement
of social justice. (Open to MSW/JD students only, or with the permission of both program areas.) (Credit
Weight 4.0. Cross listed with Social Work SWRK-8626).

BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES /INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY COURSES
(Joint Departmental Offering)
Note: These courses are a joint offering between the Department of Biomedical Science and the Department of
Integrative Biology.

Fundamentals Courses: Fundamentals courses cover subject matter that is considered central to a
comprehensive knowledge of principles and theories in the department's areas of research emphasis. The
scope of these courses extends beyond that provided at the undergraduate level. These courses may entail
formal lectures, laboratory instruction and/or directed readings and discussion, but the onus is on the course
instructor to ensure that students are exposed to balanced and comprehensive coverage of the range of topics
considered to represent the field. Because of their central importance to the Biological Sciences, these courses
are offered on a regular, recurring basis.

Special Topics Courses: Special topics courses provide detailed expertise in theory and/or techniques in areas
of researchers' expertise that are especially relevant to students' thesis research. Although no less rigorous
than fundamentals courses, these courses may provide greater depth of information over a narrower subject
range. The scope of these courses extends beyond that provided at the undergraduate level. These courses
may involve a combination of lectures, laboratories, discussion, readings and/or student presentations under
the guidance of the instructor. A Special Topics course will have an explicit subtitle indicating the theme of a
particular offering. Some Special Topics courses will be offered each year. The themes will vary among years to
reflect the expertise of the instructors available and the current needs of the graduate students.

Selected Readings Courses: The primary goal of the Selected Readings courses is to develop students' skill in
objective, critical analysis of scholarly work among individuals with broadly similar research interests and
backgrounds. An equally important aspect of these courses is to promote interaction among students and
faculty and to help participants become aware of new research across a range of subdisciplines. The role of
students in selecting and presenting relevant material is central to these courses.

meeting or exceeding an IELTS overall score of 6.5 (or equivalent), with no more than one band scores of 6.0,
and no band score below 6.0 (or TOEFL) overall score of 92- no band below 23).

Degree Requirements

1) The requirements for the degree of Master of Science will be satisfied by pursuing a program of studies
consisting of five approved courses and a thesis. (A thesis is a major research project which must involve
substantial innovative work generally culminating in original results.)
2) In addition to the above course work, students are expected to attend regular departmental seminars
throughout their MSc. studies, as a fulfilment of this requirement.
3) With prior approval of the graduate coordinator, candidates may be permitted to include graduate courses
offered by other departments in their program.
4) No student will be allowed to include in his or her program a course which substantially overlaps a course
previously taken.
5) All candidates' programs are subject to approval by the Computer Science program graduate committee.
6) Students must maintain a minimum overall average of 70%, and obtain a passing grade in all courses to
remain in good standing in the program. A grade of less than 70% in a graduate course will be considered as a
failure for that course.
7) A student who fails to maintain the minimum overall average of 70% will be automatically placed on
probation in the following term.
8) A student who obtains a grade below 60% in any course will be automatically placed on probation in the
following term.
9) A student who fails to achieve satisfactory performance in any aspect of the program (course work, thesis or
major paper) may be required to withdraw.

The Master's thesis committee is chosen in the manner described under the section titled, The Program
Requirements for the Master's Degree. The final examination will take the form of an open seminar in the
presence of the Master's committee. The examination will be open to the public.

Each student must obtain approval of his or her program, in writing, from the graduate coordinator within
three weeks of registration. Subsequent changes require written approval from the graduate coordinator.

Co-op Requirements
Recruitment and selection into the co-op element of this program will take place in each of the fall, winter and
summer semesters. Admission and pre-employment readiness training will be held in one semester, students
will compete for positions in the next semester and complete one eight-month placement (equivalent of two
work terms) in the following two semesters.

In addition to the Program Requirements for the Master of Science Degree, students participating in the co-op
option must satisfy the following conditions:

1) Have been a full-time student in the Master’s program in Computer Science;


                                                                                                                 222
Spring 2024 Academic Calendar
2) Have successfully completed a minimum of one study term prior to applying for admission to the co-op
stream;
3) Can not be on a leave of absence in the two terms immediately prior to the work terms;
4) Have at least one semester of study remaining upon completion of their work terms in a maximum of three
years in the Master’s program;
5) Have obtained written permission from the academic supervisor/co-supervisors;
6) Have their placement(s) confirmed by the Centre for Career Education
7) Are not planning to take courses during the work terms.

All Co-op positions must be full-time, paid, related to the degree program and approved by the University. The
process of securing a co-op position is competitive. Co-op students will apply for work opportunities as
advertised by the Centre for Career Education using an Internet-based software program and employers will
make interview and hiring decisions. Students are also encouraged to seek co-op employment outside of the
advertised postings by completing a guided job search process facilitated by the Centre for Career Education.

Withdrawal from the co-op program will be granted on an exception basis only as it must be determined that
the student has no outstanding commitments to employers. Students who wish to withdraw must meet with a
Co-op Coordinator and complete a withdrawal form. However, the only time a student may withdraw from an
undergraduate co-op program without further co-op fee payment implications is by the 1st Friday of classes
after their first co-op work term. Students who withdraw from Co-operative Education at any other time will be
liable for paying the co-op fee for the term in which they are dropping and one additional term. This will help
offset the costs of developing another student for placement.

In the interest of building solid partnerships with employers, students who have accepted a co-op employment
offer (either by ranking a position in round 1 of the job competition or by accepting a position either verbally or
in writing in later rounds) must honour that commitment. Therefore, once students have accepted an offer of
employment for a work term, they will be considered registered in the appropriate work term course and must
remain in the co-op program until they have completed their work term requirements. Failure to honour these
commitments and/or to complete all work term requirements will lead to being required to withdraw from the
co-op program and will result in a failing grade on his/her transcript for that work term.

The qualifying examinations must be taken by all students entering the doctoral program.

The qualifying examination is intended to ensure that the student has a mastery of the fundamentals in
Computer Science in order to undertake research. This is a breadth requirement in that it does not require the
student to be able to undertake research in each of the fundamental areas. Rather, the student must
demonstrate knowledge, in each of the fundamental areas, at a level that would be expected of a graduate
from a four-year Honours Computer Science university-degree program.

The student must obtain a grade of 70% in each test and/or course works done for the qualifying examination.

Graduate Courses
Each student must complete no less than two and usually no more than four graduate Computer Science
courses, not including those taken for credit in a Master's degree, and not including seminar or thesis courses.
Graduate course selection will be determined by the student's Doctoral Committee. Graduate credit will be
given for a grade of 70% or higher in a graduate course.

Comprehensive Examination
The comprehensive examination is one in which the student is asked to demonstrate a reasonable mastery of
the field of specialization; it is designed to test the student's command of knowledge and ability to integrate
that knowledge, after completion of all or most of the graduate course work. Normally, this examination is
completed during the sixth term of graduate study and is a prerequisite to admission to candidacy.

Admission to Candidacy
A student is admitted to candidacy when the student has passed the qualifying examination, has completed all
of the required graduate courses, and has passed the comprehensive examination.


COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSES

Course substitutions:
Students in the M2 MSc program may request to substitute optional courses with certain 4000-level courses in
Physics or graduate courses from another Department (usually in the Faculty of Science or Faculty of
Engineering) for some of the non-required Physics graduate courses in their program. Students in the Thesis
plan may substitute up to one optional course, students in the Major Paper plan may substitute up to two
optional courses, and students in the Coursework plan may substitute up to three optional courses, only two of
which may be 4000-level courses. Requests for course substitution must be approved by the Research
Supervisor (if applicable), Department and the Faculty of Graduate Studies within the first two weeks of the
course.

Minimum Grade Required for Graduate Credit:
Courses in which a grade of 70% or higher is received will be accepted for graduate credit. Students MUST
obtain a grade of 70% or higher in all required courses (PHYS 8100, PHYS 8960 Major Paper and PHYS 8970
Thesis).

Policy on Grades below 70%: In rare cases of extenuating circumstances, where in spite of the accommodation
provided a grade of 60-69% was obtained, the Department may recommend to the Faculty of Graduate Studies
to grant graduate credit for this course, as long as said course is not a required course, Major Paper or Thesis.
Only one such course where a grade of 60-69% was earned can receive graduate credit.

Repeating a course: If a student fails to obtain credit in a course, the course may be repeated once only, at the
discretion of the program coordinator and the Dean of Graduate Studies. No student may repeat, or replace
with another course, more than two term courses in which credit was not obtained.

Degree Requirements
1) Course Requirements: The candidate for a Master's degree will be required to take ESCI-8800 and ESCI-8900,
plus a minimum of two graduate courses normally from Earth and Environmental Sciences but may include
courses from cognate disciplines with prior approval. Not more than one course may be in Special Topics (ESCI-
8818), and not more than two courses may be from the same instructor. Additional 8000-level Science or
Engineering courses may be taken on the recommendation of the student's Master's Committee. Up to three
additional courses may be required to be taken as prerequisites or required background courses. The total of all
courses taken shall not exceed eight. The student's Master's Committee shall recommend to the program
coordinator all courses to be taken for graduate credit after discussion with the candidate. In addition, original
research work must be pursued and embodied in a thesis submitted for degree credit. Credit for graduate study
previously undertaken may be given for a maximum of two courses, but the duration of study at the University
of Windsor may not be reduced to less than the minimum of one year.

2) Examination Requirements: The final examination of a candidate for the Master's degree shall be an oral
defense of the thesis at a public lecture.

In addition to the general requirements outlined in the section titled, The Degree of Doctor of Philosophy, the
following requirements must be met by all students proceeding to the PhD. degree.

Earth Sciences (PhD)
Admission Requirements
The normal requirement for entry into the PhD program shall be an MSc in Earth Sciences or an appropriate
degree in a cognate discipline. Students who have enrolled in the MSc. program may apply to transfer to the
Ph.D. program after one year of registration, and must have achieved a minimum 80% average in course work
and have a strong recommendation from their thesis committee.

Degree Requirements and Structure
Students entering the PhD. program with an MSc degree will be required to:
a) Take a minimum of four, one-semester courses, including the doctoral research proposal and graduate
seminar courses.
b) Additional courses may be required if the doctoral committee feels that a particular area of the student's
background needs to be strengthened.

The required courses will be chosen in the context of the student's previous education to ensure a sufficient
intellectual challenge, commensurate with the PhD degree.

Students transferring into the PhD program after having completed one year of the MSc degree will be required
to take a minimum of six courses in total, including the doctoral research proposal and graduate seminar
courses.


                                                                                                                256
Spring 2024 Academic Calendar
Grading: The minimum passing grade in graduate courses is 70%. Any student whose performance is deemed
unsatisfactory in course work or research will be required to withdraw.

Doctoral Committee: The doctoral committee shall comprise the advisor(s), two other faculty members from
the Department of Earth Sciences and one faculty member from another department at the University of
Windsor. Other committee members can be added where appropriate (e.g. from other universities or from
industry).

Research Proposals: Doctoral candidates will be required to prepare research proposals that must be
successfully defended in a public forum, prior to continuation in the program. Presentation of the research
proposal will normally be at the end of the first calendar year after enrollment.

Dissertation: The student will be required to submit a dissertation that is a compilation of original research
carried out by the student, under the supervision of the student's advisor(s) and the doctoral committee. The
dissertation may be submitted in a traditional format or as a compilation of published papers and/or
manuscripts, linked by introductory and conclusion chapters. In the latter case, the contribution of the student
to any jointly authored papers must be clearly stated and justified.

Progress reports: The student will submit annual research progress reports to the doctoral committee.
Continuation in the program is dependent on a satisfactory progress report. The Faculty of Graduate Studies
also monitors student progress via an annual progress report submitted by the student and supervisor.

Examinations
Comprehensive Examination: The comprehensive examination will normally occur at the end of the first year
and will typically be held in conjunction with the defense of the research proposal. However, the two may be
held at different times for logistical or other reasons. The comprehensive exam is complementary to the
defense of the research proposal, and is designed to assess whether the student's scientific knowledge is
appropriate for continuance in the Ph.D. program, and to ensure that the student has the background
knowledge that is required for their research. A pass/fail decision will be by a majority vote of the committee. If
a student should fail the comprehensive exam, he or she will be allowed to re-sit the exam within a four-month
period after the first exam. The student will be required to withdraw from the program should he or she fail the
second exam.

Defense: The dissertation will be defended by the student and examined by an examination committee in a
public defense. The examination committee will comprise the student's doctoral committee and an external
examiner.

graduate programs, facilities, and location - on the Canada-US border at the heart of the world’s most
economically significant freshwater system.

GLIER research is currently focussed on two interrelated themes that assess the impact of multiple stressors on
large lakes and their watersheds. The stressors include metal and organic chemical contamination, species
invasions, climate change, harvesting of populations, nutrient enrichment, and habitat destruction. The themes
are environmental chemistry and toxicology, and conservation and resource management. GLIER’s 5200 m2,
tri-level, dedicated facility on the Detroit River is without parallel in Canada. It includes over 25 extensively
equipped laboratories, offices for researchers and post-doctoral and graduate students, and conference and
meeting rooms. GLIER maintains a private boat launch on the Detroit River and has dedicated boats.

GLIER has the distinction of housing the only university-based environmental analytical laboratory in Canada
accredited by the Canadian Association of Environmental Analytical Laboratories (CAEAL) to international
standards of performance.

Further details of activities and facilities appear on GLIER’s website at www.uwindsor.ca/glier.

Fluid Dynamics Research Institute

GLOSSARY
This glossary explains some terms which are used frequently throughout this Calendar. It is intended as a quick-
reference guide and may not necessarily offer the complete, official definitions and explanations as they are
applied to the University's programs and the administration of its regulations.

Antirequisite - A course or other level of attainment which, if already successfully completed, does not permit
registration for credit in another course, and which cannot be taken for credit concurrently with that other
course.

Attempt - Generally, any course for which a final grade has been assigned, including "WF" - Withdrew Failing.
Failures which are repeated and for which credit is subsequently earned may or may not be considered as
attempts, depending upon individual faculty regulations. If a student transfers from one program to another,
not all previous attempts necessarily will be counted as attempts within the student's new program.

Bachelor's Degree (Baccalaureate) - The first university
degree, for which a student follows a specific undergraduate program (e.g., B.A.- Bachelor of Arts).

Certificate - At the undergraduate level, a program consisting of eight to twelve one-term course equivalents in
a specialized area(s) of study.

Corequisite - A course which must be taken concurrently with another course which lists it as a corequisite.

Course - A unit of study identified by a course title and a unique course number. Unless otherwise specified, the
term "course" refers to a one-term, 3.0 credit course offering.

Two-Term Course - A course taught over two terms, usually the Fall and Winter terms. A two-term course
normally carries twice the credit value of a one-term course, or 6.0 credits.

Half Course - A course having a value of 1.5 credits. Half courses may be offered for fewer contact hours per
week over an entire term, or may be concentrated in either the first or the second half of a term.

Credit - A unit of academic value earned within a particular program. A credit value of 3.0 normally is assigned
to a one-term (13-week) course. A two-term course, therefore, would have a credit value of 6.0; a half-course
1.5.

Other credit values may be assigned. Some courses may be taken for varying amounts of credit within a specific
range (e.g. 2.0 to 9.0 credits); other courses may be offered for alternate credit values (e.g., 3.0 or 6.0 credits).

Credit values are used in the calculation of averages for academic standing and in the determination of the
student's year or level within a specific program. (See also "Weight").

Cross-Listed Courses - Courses which are listed under two different numbers in two different subject areas.
Cross-listed courses may be taken in either subject area, but credit may be earned in only one course.

Cumulative Average - An average which is based upon all courses counted as attempts within a student's
career.


                                                                                                                  261

Diploma - At the undergraduate level, a program of study less extensive than a degree program, but requiring
more courses than a certificate program.

Full-Time Student - See "Categories of Registration".

Linked Courses - Credit may not be allocated to certain courses until a subsequent course is also successfully
completed. Such "linking" of courses will be noted in the course descriptions.

Major - A formal, specific concentration of courses within a subject area as defined by its degree program(s).

Major Average - An average based upon courses attempted within the student's major as defined by the
student's degree program.

Part-Time Student - See "Categories of Registration".

Prerequisite - A course for which credit must have been earned prior to registration in another course which
lists it as a prerequisite. ("Consent of Instructor" may be listed as an alternative to, or in addition to a given
course prerequisite.)

Program - A combination of courses in a subject area (or areas) which fulfills the requirements for a degree,
certificate, or diploma.

Program Approval - For students in certain programs, consulting with and obtaining the signed approval of
course selections by a faculty advisor may be required as part of the registration process.

Registration - The process of selecting courses, obtaining faculty approval for course selections where
necessary, and making the appropriate arrangements with the University to pay the required fees.

Required Course - A course for which credit must be earned in a student's program.

Semester - Same as "Term"

Standing Required - Individual faculties and set out specific requirements which students must meet in order to
continue in their programs. These requirements normally include the maintenance of specific minimum
cumulative and major averages, and also place certain restrictions upon the number of courses a student is
permitted to have failed. Progress is reviewed at the end of each term.

Term - An academic period of twelve or thirteen weeks' duration. The Fall term extends from September to
December; the Winter term from January to April. Intersession, which extends for six weeks from mid-May
through the end of June, and Summer Session, which extends from the beginning of July to mid-August are
considered together as a single term.

Transcript - A document issued by the Office of the Registrar which records all aspects of a student's
registrations and grades obtained at the University. An "official" transcript is one which bears the official seal of
the University and which is sent directly to another institution or official of an organization. "Unofficial"
transcripts also may be issued to the student.

Withdrawal - A formal procedure set out within the regulations of the University for withdrawing from an
individual course(s), or from the University entirely.


                                                                                                                     262

Weight - For students registered in the Faculty of Engineering, the calculation of averages is based upon a
weighting factor. The weight of an individual course is equal to the number of lecture hours per week, plus one-
half of the number of laboratory and/or tutorial hours per week.

Year (or Semester) - Attaining a particular Year or Semester level depends upon earning credit for a specific
number of courses. The number of courses normally taken in one term/semester determines the Semester
level; the number of courses normally taken in a program over both the Fall and Winter terms of a "regular"
academic year would determine the Year level. In some programs, the attainment of a specific level also may
reflect the earning of credits in a particular group or sequence of courses.
