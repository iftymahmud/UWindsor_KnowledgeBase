A Picture Says a Thousand Words…
When new alumni leave the University of Windsor campus to pursue the next chapter in their lives, they not only take with them the accomplishment of earning a degree, but they also take treasured memories of campus life, and friendships that will last a lifetime.
It is this unique sense of a collegiate community, of a time when students have life-changing opportunities and they establish a special ‘sense of place’ that can be found within the pages of this new photo book.
 
This is a feeling that the University of Windsor Alumni Association knows very well and as a result, they have sponsored the entire cost of the photo book so that all of the proceeds will go toward student scholarships.
Through Richard Bain’s lens, this book captures the last two years of campus life. But it captures so much more than that. It is a reminder of the unique characteristics and characters that bring this campus to life. It is a yearbook for our very recent past, but it is also a yearbook for all of our alumni, our faculty, our staff, our community partners and our neighbours — for all Lancers who have a shared history on this campus.
They say a picture says a thousand words, and each one captured in this book helps tell the story of the University of Windsor’s vibrant campus community. Together with the contributions of a few of distinguished authors, we are pleased to present this keepsake of campus life during the University of Windsor’s 50th Anniversary in 2013.

HOCKEYTOWN WINTER FESTIVAL
Monday, December 16th @ 6:30pm / Comerica Park

Lancers and Mustangs set to face-off in Hockeytown Winter Festival

The University of Windsor Lancers and the Western University Mustangs  will face-off in the 2014 SiriusXM Hockeytown Winter Festival on Monday, December 16th at 6:30pm at Comerica Park in Detroit, Michigan.

TICKET INFORMATION:
Get your tickets now for the Hockeytown Winter Festival between the Lancers and the Mustangs!

Tickets are $15/general admission.

To purchase your tickets, see Elisa Mitton in the Home Events office inside the St. Denis Centre's athletic department offices on Monday to Friday between 9am - 3pm. For more information, contact the ticket office at: (519) 253-3000 ext. 2447.

ABOUT THE EVENT:
The Lancers and Mustangs will renew their rivalry in a regular season contest on Monday, December 16 at Comerica Park in Detroit, Michigan as one of the festival's first events. The game will replace the previously scheduled OUA contest between the two teams scheduled for this Friday (October 25) at South Windsor Arena.
 
"We are thrilled to be able to participate in this unique outdoor sporting event," commented University of Windsor athletic director Mike Havey. "This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for our student-athletes and something I know they'll remember forever."
 
More than 250,000 people are expected to descend on Comerica Park, the home of the Detroit Tigers, for the SiriusXM Hockeytown Winter Festival, an outdoor celebration of hockey that will start in mid-December. The infield of the Tigers' home ballpark will be turned into a hockey rink and will feature games between teams representing every level of hockey.
 
In addition to the Lancers-Mustangs game, the SiriusXM Hockeytown Winter Festival will also feature American Hockey League, Ontario Hockey League, NCAA, high school and youth games throughout the month of December.
 
"As a hockey program, this fulfills our mission statement to give our players lifetime experiences that will help them grow as leaders in the community," said University of Windsor head coach Kevin Hamlin.   "Having a league game outdoors against our rivals places an even greater importance on the game, and our players wouldn't want it any other way."

Lancer men reclaim OUA Championship title
Guelph Gryphons women, Windsor Lancers men crowned OUA champions
 
The University of Windsor Lancer men and the University of Guelph Gryphon women were crowned the 2014 OUA track and field champions on Saturday evening (Feb. 22) at the Toronto Track and Field Centre.
 
The Lancers re-claimed the men's banner, which is their 15th in the last 16 seasons. They finished the meet with 158 points, which was only five better than the Gryphons and 21 better than the host, Lions.
 
The Gryphons women's team have now won back-to-back banners and claimed it with a score of 150.5 points, 14.5 points ahead of second-place Toronto Varsity Blues and Western Mustangs. The Lancers finished fourth with 101.5 points; while the host, York Lions rounded out the top five teams with 69.
 
The Lancers were led to victory largely by the efforts of Alex Ullman who struck gold in the 600m with a time of 1:20.48. He capped off the day by running anchor for a come-from-behind victory in the 4x400m relay, where the top three teams all broke the previous OUA meet mark. Their time of 3:17.24 now stands as the best time in the OUA championships, a record previously held by the Mustangs from 1993. Brandon Wilhelm also found the top of the podium, as his jump of 2.04m was good for gold in the high jump.
 
On the women's side, the Gryphons got out to an early start on day two as Sarah Dougherty won the weight throw with a distance of 17.22m. Shortly after, Katelyn Ayers won the 600m gold medal with a time of 1:31.92, which was her second gold of the championships.

The Lancer women had another strong day of competition and finished fourth overall with 101.5 points, behind Guelph, Toronto and Western. Please see below for a complete list of medalists, and click here to view the complete championship results.
 
Another meet record fell on the second day of competition as York's Khamica Bingham lowered the 60m mark she set last year to a blazing-fast 7.23 seconds. Another record was nearly set in the men's 60m race with York's Dontae Richards-Kwok tying the 6.66 seconds initially put up by former York runner Desai Williams in 1983.
 
Their gold medals in the 60m were two of the six the Lions won on Saturday. Eric Brathwaite won his second gold of the weekend, this time in the shot put with a toss of 17.28m, finishing just ahead of teammate Umar Khan, who picked up the silver. Also in the field events, David McKay won his third straight title in the pole vault with a top height of 4.91m, and Richard Jansen finished in first place in the triple jump with a distance of 14.46m.
 
Rounding out the hosts gold medals was the women's 4x200m relay team, which finished atop the podium with a time of 1:39.95, the fastest mark in the CIS this season.
 
The Varsity Blues were also busy on the top of the podium striking gold in the high jump (Katia Vasilyeva, 1.72m), 1500m (Gabriela Stafford, 4:28.71), and the women's 4x400m relay (3:45.50).
 
The Gryphons won gold in the men's 4x200m relay with a time of 1:29.01, edging out the Lions who were 16 tenths of a second behind. Adding to the Gryphons' gold medal count was Ross Proudooft who ran 3:49.56 in the 1500m.
 
Rounding out the OUA champions on Saturday was Caroline Ehrhardt of the Mustangs who won the triple jump with a leap of 12.83m, which was her second gold medal of the championships.
 
In addition to the hardware won at the OUA championships, the top two finishers from each event, as well as all student-athletes who surpassed the automatic standards, have qualified for the CIS championships, which will take place March 6-8 at the University of Alberta in Edmonton.

Windsor tops Gaels 73-48, claims fifth OUA title
Box Score WINDSOR, Ont.- The Windsor Lancers women's basketball team claimed its second-straight conference banner on Saturday evening at the St. Denis Centre, defeating the Queen's Gaels 73-48 in the OUA Final, presented by ArcelorMittal Dofasco.

Windsor claims its fifth OUA title in the last six seasons, and joins Toronto and Laurentian as the only women's basketball programs to have claimed at least five Ontario conference championships since it was first awarded in 1971-72. The Lancers improve their OUA Final record to 5-1 over the last six years.

Miah-Marie Langlois recorded a game-high 25 points and tallied eight assists, six rebounds and two steals, earning herself the Porter Airlines player of the game honour. Jessica Clemencon scored 21 points and added eight rebounds for Windsor, who extends its playoff winning streak to 12 games. Korissa Williams tallied 14 points and rookie Cheyanne Roger grabbed a game-high 10 rebounds.

Veterans Liz Boag and Jenny Wright each scored a team-best 17 points for the Gaels who last won the conference title in the 2000-01 season. Queen's joins Windsor at the St. Denis Centre next weekend for the CIS Final 8 national championships, as will the Laurier Golden Hawks who earned the final OUA berth by defeating Carleton in double-overtime in the bronze medal match earlier on Saturday.

The Lancers jumped out to a 9-0 lead in the opening quarter. After a slow start in the first two minutes, Williams notched back-to-back transition lay-ups off a pair of Gaels turnovers. Langlois then went to work, as the OUA defensive player of the year followed a running jumper down the middle with a baseline fade-away. Another mid-range jumper from the Windsor native gave the women a commanding 17-3 lead at the 3:30 point of the first.

Williams made good on another transition basket on a fast-break outlet from Kristine Lalonde. Clemencon nailed a deep two at the buzzer, and led all players with eight first-quarter points as Windsor took a 23-7 lead into the second.

The Gaels offence came alive early in the second, as Wright's three-pointer helped the visitors go on a mini run. The Kingston, Ont. native then picked up two more points on a strong drive to the basket while being fouled and converted her ensuing free-throw to cap off an 8-2 run.

However, Clemencon continued her potent perimeter shooting, knocking down two more jumpers to stem the Gaels tide. Boag picked up her first three-pointer of the game, but Langlois responded with two more baskets of her own to keep Windsor's offence rolling through the first half.

Boag followed another three with a lay-up, but Clemencon responded with a basket and foul shot. The St. Rambert, France native polished off an impressive first half with a jumper on Windsor's final second quarter possession, as Windsor took a 43-27 lead into the locker rooms.

Clemencon finished the half with 19 points, as the Lancers shot just under 53% from the field. Queen's was led by Boag's 12 points and worked at a 34.6% efficiency.
Windsor used a 10-2 run through the first five minutes of the third quarter to extend its lead. Langlois polished off the Lancers streak with two speedy penetrations inside to put the home team up 24. The offense slowed for both squads in the second part of the third, as the teams combined for just 18 points in the quarter, and the Lancers maintained a 20-point advantage heading into the final period.

The three-time defending CIS champions only padded their lead in the final 10 minutes of play to earn their second conference championship in as many years, and will look to add a fourth straight national title to their trophy case next weekend at the St. Denis Centre. Windsor shot 42.3% in the championship, compared to 31.6% from the Gaels. The Lancers also won the glass battle, totalling 52 boards to 33 from Queen's.

The CIS Final 8 begins next Friday, March 14 at the St. Denis Centre. Stay tuned to GoLancers.ca for all championship schedule updates.

Defending champ Lancers seeded #1
OTTAWA (CIS) – For the second straight season and for the third time in four years, the three-time reigning national champion Windsor Lancers head into the ArcelorMittal Dofasco CIS women's basketball championship as tournament favourites.
 
CHAMPIONSHIP WEBSITE: http://english.cis-sic.ca/championships/wbkb/index
 
The seeding was announced Sunday night for the CIS Final 8, hosted by the University of Windsor. The single-elimination tournament gets under way Friday at the St. Denis Centre and culminates next Sunday at 8 p.m. with the gold-medal final, live on Sportsnet 360.
 
Sportsnet 360 also has live coverage of Saturday's semifinals at 3 and 5 p.m. All 11 games from the competition - including televised contests - will be webcast live on www.CIS-SIC.tv.
 
Joining the host Lancers (OUA champions) in their quest for the Bronze Baby Trophy are the second-seeded Saint Mary's Huskies (AUS champs), No. 3 Saskatchewan Huskies (Canada West champs), No. 4 McGill Martlets (RSEQ champs), No. 5 Fraser Valley Cascades (Canada West finalists), No. 6 Queen's Gaels (OUA finalists), No. 7 Alberta Pandas (Canada West bronze medallists) and No. 8 Wilfrid Laurier Golden Hawks (OUA bronze medallists).
 
In Friday's quarter-finals, Alberta will battle Saint Mary's in the 1 p.m. opener, followed by Queen's vs. Saskatchewan at 3 p.m., Laurier and Windsor at 6 p.m., and Fraser Valley and McGill in the 8 p.m. nightcap.
 
The Lancers' first Bronze Baby Trophy triumph came at the St. Denis Centre in 2011, when they became the first team in CIS women's hoops history to be crowned on home court. They added titles in Calgary two years ago and in Regina last winter.
 
This season, Windsor and Saint Mary's were the only teams to reach No. 1 in the national rankings, topping seven and six weekly polls, respectively.
 
Alberta received the at-large berth (wildcard) following a vote by a committee of CIS coaches. The Pandas were ranked in the top five in the country all season – including No. 3 each of the last nine polls – but settled for bronze at the Canada West Final Four after being upset by Fraser Valley in the semifinal round.
 
NOTES: A complete championship preview will follow on Tuesday... The CIS all-Canadians and major award winners will be announced at a banquet on Thursday evening.

About Youth Science Canada
Fueling the curiosity of Canadian youth through STEM projects
Established in 1966, Youth Science Canada fuels the curiosity of Canadian youth through science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) projects. We work to ensure that Canadian youth have the capacity and skills to generate and answer questions and identify and solve problems.

To this end, we help provide various opportunities for interested youth to get involved in exciting and imaginative inquiry and project-based science. More than 8,000 dedicated volunteers nationwide help us to achieve this. And thanks to these combined efforts, every year in Canada, more than 500,000 bright, inquisitive minds get involved in project-based science — about the same number of Canadian youth as are registered in minor hockey. These young STEM enthusiasts are Canada’s next generation of innovators and entrepreneurs.

The Canada-Wide Science Fair is proudly organized by Youth Science Canada.

There must have been an oversight. I don't see Donovan's picture on here. He received his diploma, and 'graciously' returned it to Dr. Wideman. It was priceless.

OUT IN WINDSOR
Fine Arts: A Dynamic Cultural Community
Being an artist in Windsor is to experience the best in creative culture, says Susan Gold, a practicing artist and professor emeritus of visual arts at the University of Windsor.
The community provides a critical mass of support for artists, helping them to develop and encouraging cross-fertilization between disciplines, genres, and values.
The only thing better than to be an artist is to be a patron of the arts and enjoy the many strands of Windsor's rich cultural tapestry.
School of Creative Arts
The new School of Creative Arts (SoCA) downtown campus is home to the Visual Arts and VABE programs and includes a SoCA Projects Gallery and VABE Projects Display.
Windsor Art Community
The Art Gallery of Windsor collects, conserves, interprets, and presents Canadian art. Its riverfront building in downtown Windsor is a place to view significant works of art by local, regional, and national artists. The gallery's collection of more than 3,000 works of art—including paintings, drawings, prints, photographs, sculptures, illustrations, and videos—covers the period from about 1750 through to the present day.
The Arts Council - Windsor & Region is an umbrella organization representing and promoting all artistic endeavour within Windsor and Essex County. It operates the Artspeak Gallery in the heart of Olde Walkerville, as well as ArtsNotes, one of Windsor’s most comprehensive events listings.
Artcite artist-run centre maintains a balanced and perse program of visual art exhibitions and events, including performance, film and video screenings, artists' lectures and workshops, and presentations of experimental music and interdisciplinary art production by local, regional, national and international artists. It is located in a store front of the Capitol Theatre and Arts Centre in Windsor's downtown core.
Common Ground is an unjuried exhibition space available to all interested self-motivated artists. It is located about one-half kilometre west of the UWindsor campus, in the Mackenzie Hall Cultural Centre.
The Windsor Sculpture Park is a museum without walls, a unique showcase of more than 30 large-scale, internationally-recognized works of contemporary sculpture on the shores of the Detroit River, stretching from the University of Windsor campus to the Art Gallery of Windsor.
Both the city and the county are home to commercial galleries, with particular concentration in Windsor's downtown core, Walkerville, and Riverside.
Windsor Art Festivals
The city also boasts a number of festivals celebrating visual arts, including
Art in the Park, which features exhibitors from all over Ontario annually displaying their work on the grounds surrounding Willistead Manor
Art by the River set on the grounds of Amherstburg’s historic Fort Malden
Walkerville Fringe Fest
Walkerville Art Walk
Detroit Art Community
As well, just across the river, southwestern Michigan is home to a burgeoning arts scene, with flagship institutions including the Detroit Institute of Arts and the Cranbrook Academy of Art, and creative centres like Ann Arbor and Birmingham.

M-Basketball hosts Tip-off Classic on Wednesday
Windsor, ON - The Windsor men's basketball team will host the Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne (IPFW) Mastodons on Wednesday as part of their annual NCAA/OUA Tip-Off Classic.
 
The game will be played on Wednesday August 13th at 5:00pm at the St. Denis Centre. Tickets for the event will be available at the door for $5.
 
This is the tenth consecutive year that head coach Chris Oliver has brought in an NCAA team for late-summer action at the University of Windsor.
 
"The early competition will be the first game for many of our newcomers," said Oliver. "However, it will also be the first game for many veteran players in new roles as we re-define our team after graduating three impactful players."
 
The IPFW Mastodons are coming off their most successful season in program history with a record breaking 25-11 overall season record. They are led by 6'9" senior Steve Forbes, who finished last season second in team scoring with 12.1 points per game and 5.3 rebounds per game.
 
"We are grateful about the opportunity to measure ourselves against an NCAA Division I team and to be able to once again bring another unique experience to our campus and community," Oliver continued.
 
The Lancers will kick-off training camp on August 8th in preparation for their contest against the Mastodons.

Lancers earn impressive 89-74 win over IPFW
Mitch Farrell led all scorers with 27 points on 10-14 shooting and 7 of 9 from three point range.
Windsor, ON - The Windsor Lancers men's basketball team earned an impressive 89-74 victory over the Indiana Purdue at Fort Wayne Mastodons in their annual OUA-NCAA Tip-Off Classic on Wednesday night at the St. Denis Centre.

This is the fourth straight year that Head Coach Chris Oliver's squad has earned a pre-season victory over an NCAA Division I opponent. The Lancers previously earned wins over Oakland University, University of South Alabama, and The Citadel.

For the Lancers, guard Mitch Farrell turned in an electric performance in his Windsor debut as he led all scorers with 27 points on 10-14 shooting including an incredible 7 of 9 from three-point range. He also added 5 assists, 3 rebounds and 2 steals to help pace the Lancer victory.

On Wednesday night, Windsor jumped out to an early four point advantage and then went back and forth with the Mastodons through much of the first quarter. Senior Evan Matthews provided an early spark in the low post as the two teams were tied 20-20 after the opening ten minutes.

In the second quarter, the Lancers again opened up a slight lead but weren't able to break free of the Mastodons. Another evenly played quarter ended with IPFW holding a slim 42-40 lead at halftime.

The second half was all Windsor as the home team exploded early in the third quarter and built a ten point advantage. Veterans Rotimi Osuntola Jr. and Khalid Abdel-Gabar connected from long-range as the Lancers extended to a commanding 66-52 lead. The Lancers were on fire from behind the arc throughout the contest and finished 17-34 from three-point range.

The Mastodons were unable to mount a charge in the fourth quarter as Farrell and Alex Campbell hit from deep to increase the Lancer lead as they cruised to the 89-74 win.

In addition to Farrell's 27 points, the new look Lancers also got 17 points and 7 rebounds from Rotimi Osuntola Jr. and 15 points from Khalid Abdel-Gabar. Alex Campbell chipped in with 12 points and Evan Matthews added 9 points and 6 rebounds while playing some tremendous low post defense.

The Lancers next pre-season action will take place on September 20th when they host Humber College at 4pm at the St. Denis Centre.

OUA champs open season against Guelph
After claiming their first Queen's Cup Championship in 16 years, the 2014-15 Windsor Lancers men's hockey team is set to make another run for the Queen's Cup title and a second consecutive appearance in the CIS University Cup championship.
 
The Lancers will kick-off the season this Wednesday when they take on the Guelph Gryphons in their season opener at 7:30pm at South Windsor Arena.
 
The Lancers first OUA banner since the 1997-98 season didn't come easy, as their opponents from McGill put together a substantial late third period run after going down by three goals, and nearly sent the game into overtime with under a minute remaining in regulation.
 
However, an incredible 50-save performance by Queen's Cup player of the game Parker Van Buskirk and a two-goal outburst in the second period of play proved to be enough for the Lancers to win their second OUA banner in their last three trips to the Queen's Cup Final.
 
Few had predicted Windsor's run at the outset of the post-season, as the Lancers came into the playoffs ranked fourth in the OUA West division with a 17-11-0 record but had played .500 hockey throughout the second-half of the season. However, after earning a victory over the bitter rival and top-seeded Western Mustangs in the division semi-finals where Windsor came back from one-game down to win the best-of-three, it was full-steam ahead for the Lancer men. They dominated the division finals against Lakehead, another higher seed in the West, winning the series by a combined score of 13-3 in two-straight games.
 
The outlook for 2014-15 is a positive one for the Lancers, as they are returning their top two point producers from last year Spencer Pommells and captain Drew Palmer. Pommells tallied over 30 points for the second straight year notching 32 points to lead the Lancers while Palmer notched 17 assists and recording 25 points.
 
Kenny Bradford led all Lancer blue-liners with 15 points, including 10 goals. Goaltender Parker Van Buskirk, entering his final year of eligibility, will look to build from his success from last season where he garnered a 2.66 goals-against average and .920 save percentage to go along with 16 wins in the regular season.
 
The Lancers will not be without a couple of significant losses this year, as former OUA all-star Evan Stibbard and prominent forward Derek Lanoue graduated following last season. Fifth year defenseman Christian Steingraber also completed his education, leaving holes at both the front and back of the line-up.
 
Head coach Kevin Hamlin hopes to begin filling those voids with his 2014-15 recruiting class, which includes LaSalle Vipers captain Dylan Denomme. This past season, the Windsor, ON native was named a western conference all-star, was a nominee for league MVP, and putt up career best 37 goals to go along with 72 points in 39 games. He also became the franchise's all-time leading goal scorer, ending his career with 113 goals.
 
The Lancers and Gryphons will open the season at South Windsor Arena this Wednesday night, with puck-drop set for 7:30 p.m. Fans will receive a commemorative 2014 Queen's Cup Championship team poster and also have the chance to take their photo with the second oldest trophy in history, the Queen's Cup. Season tickets will also be available at the gate for only $50. 

The game will also be broadcast live at www.oua.tv.

Men's Hockey
After claiming their first Queen's Cup Championship in 16 years, the 2014-15 Windsor Lancers men's hockey team is set to make another run for the Queen's Cup title and a second consecutive appearance in the CIS University Cup championship.
 
The Lancers will kick-off the season this Wednesday when they take on the Guelph Gryphons in their season opener at 7:30pm at South Windsor Arena. Season tickets are available at the gate, and the game can also be viewed live at www.oua.tv.
 
The outlook for 2014-15 is a positive one for the Lancers, as they are returning their top two point producers from last year Spencer Pommells and captain Drew Palmer. Pommells tallied over 30 points for the second straight year notching 32 points to lead the Lancers while Palmer notched 17 assists and recording 25 points.
 
Kenny Bradford led all Lancer blue-liners with 15 points, including 10 goals. Goaltender Parker Van Buskirk, entering his final year of eligibility, will look to build from his success from last season where he garnered a 2.66 goals-against average and .920 save percentage to go along with 16 wins in the regular season.
 
Football
4-0 for the first time since 1987, the Lancer Football team will look to keep their unbeaten streak alive as they host the Guelph Gryphons this Saturday at 1:00pm at Alumni Field.
 
It is also Alumni Weekend Saturday, and all fans who attend the game are invited to celebrate with the UWindsor Alumni Association at a special Alumni Tailgate party starting at 11:30am inside the stadium. The Department of Athletics will also be giving away a semester of FREE tuition to a lucky UWindsor Student. All students are encouraged to attend to cheer on the Blue & Gold to have a chance to win!
 
Windsor is coming off a 35-3 win over  the York Lions last weekend in Toronto. The No. 6 ranked Gryphons are coming off of their bye week, but are riding a three game win streak heading into this weekend.
 
The Lancers last faced the Gryphons in the OUA quarter-finals last year when they fell 31-21 to the host team.
 
Heading into the contest, fifth year quarterback Austin Kennedy is only six touchdown passes from setting the OUA career record in that category. The current record is held by Josh Sacobie from Queen's University (2004-08) with 79.
 
The action can be seen LIVE at www.oua.tv starting at 1:00pm on Saturday.   
 
Men's & Women's Soccer
Coming off solid weekend in Sault Ste, Marie, the Lancer Soccer program is back home for a pair of games. On Wednesday night the Lancers will host their rivals, the Western Mustangs, and on Sunday will face the Laurier Golden Hawks.
 
The Lancer men's soccer program is on a four game win streak after defeating the Algoma Thunderbirds 3-0 on Saturday and 1-0 on Sunday. Goaltenders Sam Atkin and Alex Borsos each earned a shut-out for the Blue & Gold.  
 
The women dominated the Thunderbirds, defeating them 11-1 in each of the two contests. Becca Feurth had a standout weekend registering a hat-trick in each game to earn herself Lancer Athlete of the Week honours.
 
Cross Country
After a solid showing at the Windsor Open last week, the Lancer cross country team will cross the border this week to compete in the 59th annual Notre Dame Invitational in South Bend, Indiana.
 
The Lancer men are currently ranked #4 in the CIS Top Ten.
 
Women's Hockey
The Lancer women's hockey team extends their exhibition season this weekend as they travel to the nation's capital for a pair of games against Ottawa and Carleton.
 
Windsor is still looking for their first win of the exhibition season, and will are hoping to grab a pair of wins before their regular season begins on October 10th.
 
Men's Volleyball
Undefeated in exhibition play, the Lancers are taking their show on the road as they travel to Kamloops, Britich Columbia for a pair of games against Thompson Rivers University.

They include dual sport athlete Krysten Lawrence, and first year forwards Larissa Borowiec and Shailyn Waites.

It is Evan Pszczonak poster day on Friday. The first 500 youth attending the game will receive a free autographed poster of Pszczonak. Friday night is also Windsor Minor Football Day. As part of the event, the Lancer halftime show will feature the WMFA Titans against the Great Outdoor Bears in a highly anticipated contest. All Windsor Minor Football Association players who wear their jersey to the game will receive free admission to the event, and will have the chance to win plenty of great prizes.

The Lancers will also honour their graduating seniors prior to kick-off. 
 
Windsor is coming off a 24-9 loss to the Guelph Gryphons last Saturday on Alumni Weekend. Ottawa come into the weekend on a two game win streak after defeating the Waterloo Warriors 51-10 at home last week.
 
Heading into the contest, fifth year quarterback Austin Kennedy is only six touchdown passes from setting the OUA career record in that category. The current record is held by Josh Sacobie from Queen's University (2004-08) with 79.

ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY
Fast Facts
The Ed Lumley Centre for Engineering Innovation
Our History
In 1857, Assumption College welcomed its first students. This small, liberal arts college was the original predecessor of the modern university.
In 1963, it affiliated with Essex College, Canterbury College, Iona College and Holy Redeemer College to incorporate as the University of Windsor, a non-denominational, autonomous degree-granting institution.
In 2013, the University of Windsor celebrated its 50th anniversary.
Academics
The University of Windsor offers 190 undergraduates programs, 65 graduate programs and six professional programs.
Faculty: 524
Student/faculty ratio: 26:1
Our Students
Undergraduate and Graduate: 16,321 (full and part-time students)
International students: 23 percent of the student body from nearly 100 countries
Student:faculty ratio: 26:1
Hours of service contributed to Windsor-Essex communities: 1.25 million
Our Campus
The University of Windsor is a safe, urban campus covering 51 hectares (125 acres) in Windsor, Ontario.
The main campus takes up just a few city blocks, making it ideal for walking or biking.
The $112-million Centre for Engineering Innovation opened to students in 2012. Construction of a new parking structure and adjacent Innovation Centre was completed in fall 2013.
A downtown campus in heritage buildings in the city centre was completed in 2015 with the opening of the Centre for Executive and Professional Education, as well as the School of Social work in the former Windsor Star building. Major reconstruction on the former Armouries building is now complete and has preserved and restored architectural elements of the building, now home to the School for Creative Arts. The newly-built Alan Wildeman Centre for Creative Arts is adjacent to the Armouries and completes the arts precinct.
Our Towns
Windsor is one of Canada’s most ethnically diverse cities, with varied restaurants, friendly shops and ample cultural offerings just a quick walk, bike or bus ride away from campus.
The bustling metropolis of Detroit is right across the river. Take the Tunnel Bus to Detroit for an afternoon of shopping, a big concert or a professional hockey, baseball, football, or basketball game.
Our location at the intersection of North America gives our students the best of both worlds: a safe, small-town school with big-city amenities.
Lancer Athletics
The university fields 17 athletic teams that compete for provincial and national championships.
In 2015, the women's basketball team captured its fifth straight Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS) title.
The St. Denis Centre boasts indoor and outdoor tracks, a championship pool, a 2,000-seat indoor fieldhouse for basketball and volleyball games, and a new football and soccer stadium that features a FIFA-approved artificial turf surface and seating for up to 10,000 spectators.
More detailed information is available from the Office of Institutional Analysis.

OUT IN WINDSOR
A place to listen and to be heard
If music is the heartbeat of a city, Windsor has a pulse all its own. 
The University boasts an active performance program with concerts and recitals by students and faculty members both on- and off-campus. The School of Creative Arts (SoCA) organizes a wind ensemble, a jazz ensemble, and a percussion ensemble, as well as several vocal groups—including the Women’s Chamber Choir, national winner in its category of the 2008 CBC Radio choir competition.
  Many of the university’s music instructors perform professionally with the Windsor Symphony Orchestra, whose musical excellence has earned a number of awards and accolades—most recently a Juno nomination for its recording of Peter and the Wolf and Last Minute Lulu, a new work with music composed by music professor Brent Lee.
  Among the other important contributors to Windsor’s music scene are
the Windsor Folk Music & Arts Society, which sponsors a series of concerts and open-mic events
the Carrousel of Nations, a celebration of the region’s cultural diversity
Caesars Windsor
Windsor’s nightlife is renowned for its vibrant downtown, home to many dance clubs. However, the city provides opportunities to hear live music too, from the WFCU Centre, a 6900-seat concert and entertainment venue to the St. Clair Centre for the Arts with its spectacular views of the Detroit skyline; from Caesar’s Windsor, which books headline acts from around the world to intimate café spaces like the 60-seat Phog Lounge—whose indie line-up earned it the title "best live music club in Canada" in a nationwide poll on CBC Radio 3.
  And no discussion of Windsor’s music scene would be complete without mentioning the benefits afforded by proximity to Detroit. The Motor City gave rise to the Motown and techno sounds, and has produced artists as varied as Madonna and Eminem, Aretha Franklin and the White Stripes, Bob Seger and Ted Nugent.
  The city is home to the Detroit Symphony Orchestra and the Detroit Opera House. Its theatres and concert halls—including the Fisher, the Fox, the Masonic Temple, the Fillmore Detroit, the Music Hall Centre for the Performing Arts, and Saint Andrews Hall—make it a destination for every major music tour.

Student Life
OUT IN WINDSOR
Arts and Culture
  The City of Windsor is a dream university town.
It's safe, student-centered and just big enough to keep things interesting. Looking for a study break? Head down to the walking/running/biking trail along the scenic Detroit Riverfront. Take a bus into downtown for a bite at a cool new restaurant. Grab some friends and catch a show at dozens of live music venues, bars and cafes. 
When the big city beckons, Detroit is just minutes away. Take the convenient Tunnel Bus under the river for a big-name concert at the Palace at Auburn Hills or a Red Wings NHL game. Spend an afternoon shopping at cheap, trendy boutiques and browsing record stores before heading back to the comfort of your Windsor residence hall or off-campus apartment.

ACADEMIC PROGRAMS
Co-op Education
Our co-op programs integrate valuable work experience with classroom learning and professional development activities to ensure that you develop the transferable skills employers are looking for. Co-op staff and UWindsor faculty members work closely to ensure that our programs are responsive to your needs.
More than Just a Job!
As a co-op student, you'll be provided with constant feedback on your strengths and weaknesses so that you can improve and develop throughout the program of study. While on work term, you will submit learning objectives to identify which skills you want to develop on the job. You will participate in a work term assessment to give you feedback on your progress and to work with your supervisor to ensure your placement meets your expectations.
You will gain presentation skills through preparing and delivering a post work term presentation to an audience of your peers and enhance your writing skills through completing a written report. More importantly, you will make contacts and build your network which will help you find employment upon graduation.
Professional Development
Prior to graduating, co-op students must complete professional development activities designed to address relevant topics and to cultivate the skills which employers need. Activities range from attending workshops on resume writing, interview skills, report writing and presentation techniques.
Individual Attention
The co-op programs are managed by teams which are comprised of a program co-op coordinator and employer relations co-op coordinator. These individuals are committed to working with you in order to make your co-op experience truly rewarding.

The editors of a book of UWindsor reminiscences celebrate its official launch Friday. From left: Kenneth Pryke, Lois Smedick, Kate McCrone, Sheila Cameron, Ralph Johnson.
Reception launches book of remembrances
Nov 18th, 2013
Dozens of University of Windsor retirees, friends and supporters filled the reception room at Canterbury College on Friday afternoon to celebrate the official launch of Back in the Day—1963-2013: The University of Windsor As We Knew It. The book represents the collected memories of 70 retired faculty members, senior administrators and librarians, who shared their unique perspective on the development of the University of Windsor during its first 50 years.
The volume, edited by Drs. Kate McCrone, Sheila Cameron, Ralph Johnson, Kenneth Pryke and Lois Smedick, features stories of the University’s heady early days, when newly recruited faculty members found their feet and their careers in Windsor. Anecdotes include poignant stories of teaching exceptional students; tales of engineering student hijinks; and a faculty member’s first amazing encounter with a personal computer, to name a few.
“We treasure our University memories and associations,” Dr. McCrone said, thanking contributors for their efforts to bring the book to print. “It feels very special to have people of this volume representing the University in this way—after all the University is all about the people. This book is our gift to the University of Windsor on the occasion of its 50th birthday.”
Copies of Back in the Day are available for purchase at the University of Windsor bookstore.

Graduate Student Society
The Graduate Student Society is the body representing UWindsor graduate students.
It operates independently of the university and advocates for grad student interests on governing bodies, including the Board of Governors, the Senate, the Faculty of Graduate Studies Council, and administrative and academic committees.
The GSS offers a health, dental, and vision plan for members and their families, and operates the GSS Café & Restaurant, operated by Mare Nostrum, on Turtle Island Walk beside the Faculty of Education.
Learn more about the society and its services at www.uwindsor.ca/gss.

Housing and Dining
  Choosing your academic program and which University you’ll attend are important decisions.
Choosing where to live is equally as important.
There are various options but living on campus is your best choice since it puts you at the heart of student life.
It gives you a chance to be independent while being surrounded with support from residence staff.
An added benefit for international students is how close you are to the International Student Centre (ISC), located in Laurier Hall, where residence students live.
Our residence halls are conveniently located throughout the campus where it's only a short walk to:
food outlets
recreational facilities
Leddy Library
Registrars' Office
Campus Bookstore
CAW Student Centre
local banks
Bedrooms are furnished so there’s no need to purchase items such as a bed, desk, desk chairs or lamp. 
There are many adjustments to University life and by living on campus there’s no need to worry about planning or cooking your meals.
The requirement of a meal plan allows students to sample food from a variety of countries without leaving campus and the flexibility of the meal plans gives students choice.
Students can also benefit from the diversity of the City of Windsor and can take advantage of the variety of restaurants surrounding the University.

Colour Values
Our primary colour palette is made up of the three colours used in the UWindsor logo and represents the core of our personality.
The consistent use of these core colours defines and reinforces our distinctive character and should be used on all University materials.
The Pantone Matching System (PMS) is a universally recognized colour matching system based on lithography printing inks. The colour palettes include specific spot colour references for both coated and uncoated paper stocks (please note that these numbers may differ due to the way inks appear on different stocks) and process conversions (CMYK) for printing applications with limited budgets. Also included are RGB equivalents for use in Word, Excel or PowerPoint, hexadecimal equivalents for emitted light and Web applications as well as embroidery thread and vinyl lettering values.
Due to variations in browser and monitor displays, the colours should not be sampled via screen capture or other means. The original numerical values should be entered in the appropriate software program.

Correct Usage
To successfully reinforce a consistent brand, it is important that the University of Windsor logo is presented accurately when used.
Under no circumstances should any component of the logo ever be redrawn, modified or altered in any way.
Reproduction of the logo must always be completed using the approved electronic file art provided by Public Affairs and Communications.
Examples of unacceptable use
Colour
The colour of the logo or shield, or parts thereof, should never be changed beyond what is outlined in Alternate Versions.

Borders
The logo should not appear within frames or borders.
Minimum Size
The logo should never appear at a size where the total height of the shield is less than .5" (see Size and Spacing).
Screens
The logo should not appear with any screens over it or with any reduced transparency.
Size Relationship
The size relationship between logo should remain constant. If any one element changes all should change proportionately.
Drop Shadows
The logo should not appear with drop shadows or inner or outer glows.
Axis of the logo
The axis of the logo should never be skewed.
Axis of the shield
The axis of the symbol should never be skewed.
Horizontal and vertical scale
The horizontal and vertical scale should always change equally. Never stretch or condense the logo.
Position of the shield
The position of the shield should never be altered from what is outlined in Alternate Versions.
Outlining logo
Never create an outline around the logo. Contrast issues should be solved using other logo versions.
Over printing
To ensure clarity when printing on an image the logo should always be reversed on a dark or busy background. If the image is of low contrast or light tone, the logo should appear in all black.
Protective space
The logo should not appear without the minimum protective space around it as outlined in Size and Spacing.
Contrast
Do not position the logo on backgrounds with insufficient contrast. Use a logo variation that contrasts well with the background colour.
White box
The logo should never appear in a white box on a colour field or image area.
Institutional hierarchy
The institutional versions of the logo should never appear without the University of Windsor wordmark.

Technical Specifications
The recognition and perception of a brand is highly influenced by its visual presentation.
A brand’s visual identity is the overall look of its communications. Effective visual brand identity is achieved by the consistent use of particular visual elements to create distinction, such as specific fonts, colors, and graphic elements.
The best brand identity systems are executed with consistency and adherence to graphic standards like those described on this website.
Please take the time to read and properly implement the graphic standards presented on this site.
This discipline is fundamental to the success of our identity program. We encourage you to strive for quality and consistency to ensure the University of Windsor brand is experienced with clarity and integrity.

Typography
The University of Windsor approved fonts for print materials are DIN and Amasis.
Secondary fonts for limited uses include DIN Condensed (advertising materials), Tahoma, and Georgia (web).
Primary typeface: DIN
DIN is a realist sans-serif typeface that was widely used for traffic, administrative and technical applications. It was defined by the German standards body DIN - Deutsches Institut für Normung (German Institute for Standardization) in the standard sheet DIN 1451-Schriften (typefaces) in 1931.
The popularity of the typeface grew beyond this original context because it (unintentionally) embodied many of the ideological principles in play in Europe at the time – Realism and Modernism in particular – which attempted to scrape away as much of the cultural references and adornments in as many things as possible.
Now DIN is being used all over the world in a wide variety of contexts. It is celebrated for being clean, modern, bold, and striking–it looks contemporary and feels strong. It is straight-forward and “tells the truth.” Its impersonal and neutral character allows it to be a typographic backbone, letting everything else in the design and layout do the talking.
Primary typeface: Amasis
Amasis is a slab serif design which has been drawn with a humanist approach, rather than the traditional geometric construction associated with this style of letter. The result is a typeface that has an affinity with classical design, although in character it belongs to the latter decades of the twentieth century. The Amasis italic fonts, rather than being sloped roman or cursive in nature, are related more to the Old Style italics. Amasis works particularly well in small sizes where readability is important.

Unit-specific Guidelines
Official logo versions have been approved only for very few areas within the University of Windsor. These versions have a unique status in that they take the place of the UWindsor logo (ie. they should not be accompanied by the UWindsor logo). As outlined in Institutional Logo Variations there are only 11 of these authorized versions.
Departments, schools, groups and other administrative units do not have specific logos within this new identity.
The Tools & Templates page contains internal materials (letterhead, business cards, Word docs.) that have been designed to incorporate department or administrative unit information.
Please contact Public Affairs & Communications through the Advice & Assistance page if you have any questions.

ACADEMIC PROGRAMS
Student Exchange
The University of Windsor has developed a broad range of student exchange partnerships with other universities and post-secondary institutions around the world.
Currently we have 25 exchange programs in 13 countries, involving over 40 different partner institutions.
Students who participate in these exchanges invariably report that it is the single most valuable part of their university experience.
Normally, students go on exchange for one or two semesters after completing four or more semesters of study at the University of Windsor. No tuition is charged by the partner institution; students continue to pay their University of Windsor tuition while they are away. Some financial assistance is also available.
All course credits obtained on exchange may be applied to the University of Windsor degree requirements as appropriate.
While some exchanges allow students to take their courses in English, students are particularly encouraged to consider exchanges which will promote second-language competence. In these cases, students should prepare by enroling in relevant language courses at the University of Windsor from the time they begin their studies here.
Read more about student exchange, including a list of current partnership destinations.

AROUND THE UNIVERSITY
Student Government
University is all about making new friends and finding your passions and interests. So why not join one, or many, of the over 100 student clubs, organizations, academic and Greek societies we have on campus. There is something for everyone, but we are always interested to hear your new ideas and help you create new clubs for your brilliant ideas!
We want to make sure that every student at the University of Windsor has an equal voice and that’s why there is a student body to represent all groups of students. The University of Windsor Students’ Alliance represents full time undergraduate students. For the part-time undergraduates there is the Organization of Part-time Undergraduate Students, and the Graduate Students Society for all student enrolled in graduate programs.
